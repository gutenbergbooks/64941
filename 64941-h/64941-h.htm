<p><a name="Footnote_108" id="Footnote_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108"><span class="label">[108]</span></a> While these pages were passing through the press (Hy√®res, Oct. '74),
I have had an opportunity of examining 17 additional specimens of <i>N. congener</i>.
I learn from this that the pattern represented on the caput in fig. A 5,
does not accord with that in the majority of adult specimens, being usually
less defined and composed of three converging bands. Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's
description (<a href="#Page_293">p. 293</a> below) is, however, quite correct. I may
mention that three spines were present on the patella (genual joint) of
legs III in 16 specimens, the 17th specimen having but a single spine.</p>

collected at Nice, and described as <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> by Professor Ausserer.
My best thanks are due to Dr. L. Koch for having enabled me
to examine this valuable specimen. [In fig. C, the curved spine should
bend towards, and not away from, the process on its right and inner
side.]</p></div>

an assiduous search after these creatures, and the
continued study of their works and ways, has met
with ample reward and encouragement.</p>

<p>It was my wish, when originally publishing these
observations, many of which were due to the active
co-operation of friends, to invite my readers to take
part with me in my pleasure and pursuits, so that we
should from that time work together, and, by communicating
our discoveries to each other, increase our
knowledge, and at the same time enlarge the field of
our research. My intention was that we should
leave to others the necessary work of collection,
preservation, and arrangement, and that, while our
fellow naturalists pin specimens into classified cabinets,
and devote long hours to the description of
peculiarities of form and colour, we should undertake
the lighter task of complementing their labours by
observing and recording the habits and conditions of
existence of the creatures themselves.</p>

<p>Looked at in this light, the present pages and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[ 158 ]</a></span>
those of the preceding work may be regarded as so
many drawers in our <i>Cabinet of Habits</i>, and though,
as we open drawer after drawer, many gaps and
blank spaces remind us how much remains to be
done in order to complete the collection, yet the
interest and suggestiveness of the specimen-facts already
secured, should encourage and direct us onwards.
There have not been wanting instances in
which my readers have associated themselves with
me in the way indicated, and it is with pleasure,
when reviewing the entire work, that I recall how
many of its most interesting features are due to the
researches and assistance of friends,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> and commemorate
at once their discoveries and unfailing kindness.
I had certainly expected that before this time some
new species of harvesting ants would have been discovered,
either on the Riviera, where attention has
been especially called to the subject, or in other parts
of Europe, where dissimilar conditions might have
been expected to be associated with a different fauna;
but this has hitherto not been the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_109" id="Footnote_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> To all who have rendered me this valuable help I tender my cordial
thanks. I am under very special obligations to Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
for descriptions of spiders, and to Mr. F. Smith for the names of the Ants;
assistance which I should have found it almost impossible to dispense with or
to replace.</p></div>

<p>One might naturally suppose that if harvesting ants
were discovered in localities very widely distant from
each other, they would prove to belong to different
species, but thus far, both in Europe and Northern
Africa, it is the same two well-known species of <i>Atta
barbara</i> and <i>A. structor</i> that constantly reappear.</p>

<p>For instance, I have recently learned that harvesting
ants are found at Cadenabbia on the lake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159 ]</a></span>
Como, and at Montpellier in Southern France; but
on examination, the ants from the former place are
clearly seen to belong to the species <i>structor</i>, and
those from Montpellier to the two species <i>structor</i> and
<i>barbara</i>.</p>

<p>I was greatly interested to receive specimens of
ants, and of the seeds which they were carrying and
storing beneath the stones of a paved road at Cadenabbia,
for this is the northernmost point<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> at which
the habit of harvesting has as yet been noted. This
discovery suggests the possibility of the occurrence of
the habit in the warmer and more sheltered of the
Swiss valleys. When at Montpellier in May last I
frequently observed long trains of ants bringing
seeds and small dry fruits to their nests, but these
harvesters also turned out on close inspection to be
<i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A. barbara</i>, with its red-headed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160 ]</a></span>
variety. These, it will be remembered, are the only
species of European ants which have as yet been
proved to be harvesters and seed-storers in the fullest
sense of the term, that is to say, which not only
gather and carry seeds, but also store them in large
quantities below the surface of the ground.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_110" id="Footnote_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> I have related in a note at the foot of p. 4 in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> how
<i>Formica nigra</i> in England, though paying no attention to seeds generally, will
sometimes collect the fresh seeds of the sweet violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>).
</p>
<p>
When I published this account I was quite unaware that the fact that certain
English ants collect sweet violet seeds had been observed by Mr. R. Wakefield
forty years before.
</p>
<p>
This was communicated by Mr. Wakefield in a letter to Mr. John Curtis, the
substance of which was read before the Linnean Society in 1854, and published
in their Proceedings (see Proceedings of the Linnean Society, ii. 293), where we
read: "He (Mr. Wakefield) states that he has seen the black species (<i>Formica
nigra</i>, L.) for days and nights together industriously occupied in dragging to
its cells the seeds of the common violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, L.)
</p>
<p>
"He first noticed this fact on the 3rd of July, 1832; and he regards it as a
curious subject of inquiry for what purpose, if not for their own future provision,
they could accumulate these stores?" Mr. Wakefield appears to accept this as
evidence that these ants possess the habit of storing seeds; but this is not so, as
will be seen by reference to my note alluded to above, and I am inclined to
believe that they collect these particular seeds either under the mistaken
belief that they are larv√¶, to which when fresh they bear some resemblance, or
for the sake of some juices which they may obtain from the fleshy appendage
attached to the seed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_111" id="Footnote_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> Six other species belonging to the genus <i>Atta</i> are found in Europe, but they
are all unknown to me.
</p>
<p>
It seems likely that, if other harvesting ants do exist in Europe they may
belong to one of these six species; for we have seen (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 59)
that all the ants which are known to possess this habit are either members of
the genus <i>Atta</i> or belong to genera closely related to it.</p></div>

<p>In the case of <i>Pheidole megacephala</i> (the only other
European ant which I have detected collecting seeds
in large numbers), I have never been able to find
granaries or subterranean stores of any kind, though
I have frequently made extensive search for them,
and explored, to all appearance, the whole nest.</p>

<p>When we remember the great variety of ants
which inhabit Europe alone (a recent list<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> enumerating
no fewer than 104 distinct species), it certainly
may seem strange at first that only two of their
number should possess this habit. Perhaps, however,
we may yet discover that some other of these species
are true harvesters; but at present the chances seem
rather against it, since the harvesters found at such
distant points as Algiers, Cadenabbia, and Montpellier
have all turned out to belong to one or other
of the two species, <i>structor</i> or <i>barbara</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> <i>Description des Fourmis d'Europe pour servir √† l'√©tude des insectes
myrmecophilis</i>, by Ernest Andr√©, in <i>Rev. et Mag. de Zool.</i> 3<sup>e</sup> ser. tom. ii.
(1874), p. 152, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Indeed it may very well be that the numerical
superiority and wide distribution of these two species
have served to secure to them a more or less exclusive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161 ]</a></span>
right to the habit of harvesting, for it is clear that a
given tract of country can only afford supplies of
grain to a limited number of colonies; so that, if
these ants have taken up the ground and are strong
enough to maintain possession, no others would have
a chance. However this may be, I find that the
more insight I gain into the distinctive habits and
relations of animals, the more the belief impresses
itself upon me that wherever we find many closely-allied
species inhabiting restricted areas, there we
may safely look for important differences among these
species in respect of their modes of life, and in the
development of their instinct and intelligence. And
indeed this may be considered as a corollary of the
great law of natural selection, which uniformly tends
to secure the greatest possible amount of divergence
in this respect, and to prevent the co-existence in close
proximity to each other of distinct species having the
same requirements and manner of life.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, even <i>Atta barbara</i> and <i>structor</i>,
though most closely related as species, differ in habit;
the former leading a much more active life during
the winter months at Mentone than the latter, and
seeking its home rather in wild than cultivated ground.
Then what differences different ants present in respect
of strength, speed, powers of offence and defence,
numerical strength of colonies, timidity, date and
frequency of departure of winged ants from the nest,
odour emitted, combativeness, architecture and selection
of localities, nature of food, nocturnal and
diurnal habits, and in many other properties and conditions!
It is doubtless owing to dissimilarity in
these and other respects that it becomes possible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[ 162 ]</a></span>
so many species to co-exist within very narrow limits,
so that even three or four distinct kinds sometimes
form their nests so close to each other that their
galleries interlace and almost touch.</p>

<p>There are probably very few conditions of life
(except those concerned with the nature and manner
of obtaining food) which have a greater influence
either in keeping creatures apart or in bringing them
into collision, than those which constitute differences
in their respective periods of activity and development.
Thus, two species of which one has nocturnal and the
other diurnal habits, or of which one is dormant while
the other is active, may be said to travel different
roads and to be complete strangers to one another.
Complete separation of this kind is, of course, not the
rule, and the greater number of species find themselves
in more or less constant rivalry, but possess a
sufficient number of points of dissimilarity in habit
and requirements to make their co-existence possible.</p>

<p>It is curious to note what little differences, as they
seem to us, may determine the fate of an ant. For
example, the lizards will lie in wait for and greedily
seize and devour the winged males and females of
<i>structor</i> and <i>barbara</i>, though they dare not attack the
assembled workers. It is curious to watch the way
in which these worker ants will protect the winged
ants which are about to leave the nest, by gathering
round and swarming over them. When, as often
happens, the nest is placed in an old terrace-wall, one
may see the lizards creeping along or lying moulded
into the inequalities of the stones, all having their
eager eyes directed towards the swarm. One may
then see the worker ants walk with impunity straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163 ]</a></span>
up to the very noses of the lizards, while the male or
female which should chance to straggle in the same
direction would infallibly be eaten up. The lizards
plainly show their fear of the workers by the way in
which, when they make up their mind to try a dash
at some outlying part of the ant colony, they leap
through the lines in the utmost haste as if traversing
a ring of fire.</p>

<p>Now these worker ants are destitute of stings, and
I can only suppose that their power of combination,
stronger jaws and more horny coats, have gained
them this immunity. I remarked that the smaller
lizards appeared to have some difficulty in dealing
with the males and females which they captured, and
would beat and pound them against the stones before
devouring them, while the larger ones would often
make but one mouthful of them, swallowing wings
and all!</p>

<p>If it were not for this body-guard of workers it is
difficult to see how the males and females in such
situations could ever escape. It is also plain that if
the worker harvesting ants were as liable to be seized
and devoured as their winged companions, the species
would soon become extinct, for they expose themselves
more than ants ordinarily do, and their long provision-laden
trains would be almost at the mercy of
any enemy which could attack them without fear of
results.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_113" id="Footnote_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> Speaking of the enemies of ants, I may mention having seen a young robin
in England picking up and swallowing the workers of <i>Formica nigra</i> just as
if they were crumbs. I knew that birds would eat the male and female ants,
but I had thought the workers were exempt from their attacks, and, indeed,
they must be so as a rule, for otherwise they would speedily become extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Remembering this, it is interesting to note how
differently the tiger-beetle (<i>Cicendela</i>) behaves when
hunting the powerful harvesting ants and when
preying upon the weak little <i>Formica (Tapinoma)
erratica</i>; for, while it seizes the latter without taking
any precautions, it is evidently more than half afraid
of the former.</p>

<p>I have seen this beetle lying in wait near a train
of <i>structor</i> or <i>barbara</i> ants, watching until some individual
separated a little from the main body, when it
would rush forward and make a snap at it, retiring
again as quickly as it came. If the tiger-beetle fails
to seize its prey exactly behind the head it will let it
go again, and two or three ants are often thus cruelly
mutilated before a single one is carried off.</p>

<p>No doubt the beetle has learned that if once this
ant clasps its mandibles upon either antenn√¶ or legs,
nothing, not even death itself, will make it release
its hold. It therefore tries to pin the ant in such a
way that it cannot use its formidable jaws. Perhaps
the habit of forming long compact trains may have
been acquired by the ants partly with a view to
guarding against attacks of this kind.</p>

<p>The colonies of the little <i>F. erratica</i>, on the other
hand, apparently have to trust to their habit of
working under the covered ways which they construct,
as well as to their activity and great numbers
for their preservation.</p>

<p>I had thought that the very powerful, and, to me,
disagreeable, odour of these little ants might have
rendered them distasteful to the tiger-beetle, but this
is evidently not the case.</p>

<p>I have said above that, as far as our present knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165 ]</a></span>
goes, only two out of the 104 species of European
ants are possessed of the habit of collecting and
storing seed, and it may be reasonably asked how it
can have come about, if this is the case, that the
ancient authors were so well acquainted with the fact.</p>

<p>The explanation is that these writers lived on the
shores of the Mediterranean, where these two species&mdash;<i>Atta
barbara</i> and <i>structor</i>&mdash;are extremely common
objects, both on account of their abundance and their
habits. The long trains of harvesters remain exposed
to view for hours together, and <i>structor</i> seeks the
neighbourhood or even the interior of towns, so that
these ants arrest the attention even of the unobservant,
and often become familiar as the sparrows.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these two ants
display the same habits throughout all the warmer
districts which they inhabit, but whether they do so
in Switzerland, Germany, Northern France, and the
other colder portions of their range, remains one of
the many interesting questions which still await
investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Smith has recorded the presence of <i>Atta
barbara</i> in Palestine, and I have lately obtained some
curious evidence which goes to show that harvesting
ants not only carried on their operations in times
past in that country, but that their seed-stores were
on a much larger scale than any I have observed on
the Riviera.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. F. A. Pratt for the information
that mention was made of ants and their
stores in the Misna, that codification of the traditionary
and unwritten laws of the Jews, which was
commenced after the birth of Christ under the presidency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166 ]</a></span>
of Hillel, and which has at least the merit of
serving as a record of a multitude of very ancient
customs and observances which, but for it, would probably
have long ago been forgotten.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that the very first section of
the Misna is called <i>Zeraim</i>, and has to do with seeds
and crops, and I was thus enabled, without any very
prolonged search, to light upon one of the passages
in question.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> It occurs in a chapter entitled <i>De
Angulo</i> in the Latin version, treating of the <i>corner</i> of
the fields bearing crops which should be set aside for
the poor, and of the rights of the gleaners, and may
be freely rendered as follows: "The granaries of ants
(<i>Formicarum cavernul√¶</i>), which may be found in the
midst of a growing crop of corn, shall belong to the
owner of the crop; but, if these granaries are found
after the reapers have passed, the upper part (of each
heap contained in these granaries) shall go to the
poor and the lower to the proprietor." And then is
added: "The Rabbi Meir is of opinion that the
whole should go to the poor, because whenever any
doubt arises about a question of gleaning the doubt
is to be given in favour of the gleaner."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_114" id="Footnote_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> "Formicarum cavernul√¶ in media segete proprietarii censentur; pone
messores superiore parte pauperum, inferiore proprietarii. R. Meir totum
pauperum esse censet, quia quod dubium est in spicelegio, spicilegium est."
And to this the following explanatory note is appended: "Formicarum
cavernul√¶, Frumentum inibi repertum." Misna, Sect. I. Zeraim. Cap. IV. p.
25. Latine vertit et commentario illustravit Gulielmus Guisius. <i>Accedit</i>

A.D. 1690.</p></div>

<p>The intention of this very quaint bit of legislation,
or rather of the ancient custom which gave rise to it,
appears to have been the following; it was to settle
once and for all a nice point of conscience with reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[ 167 ]</a></span>
to the claims of the poor upon these ant stores.
If the heaps of grain were found among the standing
corn before the reapers reached the spot or while
they were still at work, the proprietor might claim
them without any hesitation; but, if they were discovered
after the passing of the reapers, then it was
conceivable that the ants, which during the whole time
had never ceased their labours, might have collected
some of the grain from the fallen ears of corn which
lay upon the ground, and were the property of the
gleaners. These grains would be those which the
ants had collected most recently, and would therefore
lie on the surface of each granary heap. Thus it was
settled that the upper portion of each heap should
belong to the poor, and the lower, that collected from
the standing crop, to the proprietor.</p>

<p>We may perhaps laugh at the notion of critically
discussing and legislating upon such a subject, and
think that such a pitiful matter might have been
allowed to pass among those <i>minima</i> about which even
the Jewish law need not care.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is interesting for us to learn
that a custom of the kind had its place among the
recognised traditions of the people, and that the
harvesting ants of Syria had earned a place in these
records by amassing stores of sufficient size, and so
disposed as to make them worth collecting.</p>

<p>This reminds us of what M. Germain de St. Pierre
has related (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 29) of the extent of
the depredations made among the corn crops at
Hy√®res by these ants; and doubtless other observers
who have opportunities for watching the ants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168 ]</a></span>
during the summer months might supply further confirmation.</p>

<p>It would be of interest to learn the extent and
manner of concealment of these large stores of grain,
but, during the months from October to May, I have
never seen corn in any quantity in the granaries,
though there was frequent evidence of its late presence
in the dense masses of husks of oats and other
large grain lying near the nests. In October, 1873, I
found near the entrances to a nest of <i>structor</i> a circular
mound formed of this refuse, twenty-seven inches in
diameter, and averaging two inches in thickness, while
near other nests I have found the chinks between
the stones of the terrace-wall behind which the nest
lay, literally stuffed with husks. It was plain that
these grains of cereals and the larger grasses had been
collected during the summer. The granaries in the
winter and spring contain the grains of some few of
the autumnal grasses, but are principally filled with
seeds of the other more abundant autumn-fruiting
plants belonging to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I have now collected from the granaries of these
ants the seeds or small dry fruits of fifty-four distinct
species of wild plants, and on examination I find that
during my stay in the south (from October to May)
the seeds of the distinctively spring and summer-flowering
plants are either entirely absent or are very
scarce, while the great bulk of the seeds belong to
plants which ripen their fruits in the autumn.
Thus the grains of oats, of the large fescue and brome
grasses, of quaking grasses (<i>Melica</i>), and other kinds
common near the nests in May, are conspicuously
absent in the winter, as are the fruits of all the sedges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[ 169 ]</a></span>
but one, and this one (<i>Carex distans</i>) retains its fruits
till late in the autumn. Among other spring-flowering
plants common near the nests, the seeds of which are also
absent, I may mention violets (<i>Viola odorata</i>), poppies,
(<i>Papaver</i>), certain species of <i>Veronica</i>, <i>Helianthemum
guttatum</i>, <i>Silene quinque-vulnera</i> and <i>Plantago Bellardi</i>.</p>

<p>Here a curious question arises&mdash;viz., What becomes
of the large stores of seeds which one may still find
in the nests in May, when the ants are busy pouring
fresh supplies into the nest? The answer probably is,
that, as the weather becomes warmer, ever-increasing
calls are made by the larv√¶ upon the food-resources
of the nest, and that old and new seeds rapidly disappear
together, and all the energy and activity of
the colony is needed to meet the increased demand.</p>

<p>Still, it would be interesting, if it were possible,
to assure oneself whether this is the case; that
is to say, whether the residue of the winter
stores is really consumed during the summer, or
whether a portion of it remains in the granaries until
the following autumn. One might perhaps learn
something as to this if one had an opportunity of
opening a nest late in July, and before the characteristic
autumn-fruiting plants had set their seed.
If the granaries were then principally filled with seeds
of spring-fruiting plants, and the winter seeds were
almost or entirely absent, this would afford tolerably
good negative evidence in favour of the latter having
been eaten during the summer.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, and that is, that these harvesting
ants do not habitually abandon their nests every year.
On the contrary, while many swarms leave the nests at
different seasons, a portion of the original colony, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170 ]</a></span>
of its descendants, still remains in the old home, and
very few out of the many nests which I have watched
during the past three years, and of which I have
noted and mapped the positions, have been deserted.
On my return to Mentone in October, 1873, I hastened
to examine the nests between which war had
been carried on in the previous year (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>,
p. 38), and found in one case that the vanquished nest
was completely lifeless and abandoned, while the victorious
colony was remarkably thriving, and its granaries
teemed with seeds. The locality occupied by
the other belligerent colonies had unfortunately been
built over.</p>

<p>I have often been asked whether I could give an
approximate estimate of the quantity of seeds contained
in a nest of average size, but I have hitherto felt
unable to do this in a satisfactory manner. I am now
in possession of more reliable data, and believe that
the following calculation may be taken as a near
approximation to the truth. During the spring of
1873 I removed with but very little loss the contents
of two granaries from a very extensive nest of <i>Atta
structor</i>, consisting principally of seeds of clover, fumitory,
and pellitory. These seeds, when perfectly clean
and freed from earth, weighed in the one case
4 sc. 4 grs., and in the other 5 sc. 8 grs. Now
there cannot have been less than eighty such granaries
in this nest, so that, if we take five scruples as the
average weight of the seeds in each granary, and this,
allowing for loss in collection, which we may fairly
do, we should have a total weight of more than sixteen
ounces, or one pound avoirdupois weight of seeds contained
in the nest. But, though this mass of seeds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171 ]</a></span>
represents the result of infinite labour on the part of
the ants, each individual granary contains but an
insignificant quantity, and the store-chambers often
lie at great distances apart; it is therefore impossible
to believe that the stores alluded to in the
Misna can have been as small and scattered as these
were, and we must, on the contrary, suppose them to
have been both larger and more accessible.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_115" id="Footnote_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> Perhaps these heaps of corn may have been piled up at the entrance to the
nest, as is sometimes the case when the workers, in their eagerness to secure as
much as possible of a passing harvest, bring in the supplies too fast for their
companions within the nest to be able to find room for and accommodate. When
this happens the seeds lie outside the nest until fresh chambers are prepared
for their reception.</p></div>

<p>The means employed by the ants to prevent the
germination of the seeds contained in their granaries
still remain secret, and all the experiments and investigations
which I have hitherto been able to make
have failed to give me the clue.</p>

<p>The problem to be solved is the following: Given
seeds, the readiness of which to germinate has been
proved, to place them in damp soil at depths varying
from half an inch to twenty inches below the surface
in such a manner that they shall remain there dormant,
neither germinating nor decaying, for weeks
and even months. These very seeds must be capable
of germinating after the conclusion of the experiment.</p>

<p>This is what the ants do for millions of seeds, for
the instances in which a few seeds appear to have
sprouted within the nest in defiance of the ants, are
very rare and wholly exceptional; and when after
prolonged wet weather germinated seeds are seen
outside the nest, it will usually be found that these
have the little root cut off, and are eventually carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172 ]</a></span>
back into the nest and used as food. By a fortunate
chance I have been able to prove that the seeds will
germinate in an undisturbed granary when the ants
are prevented from obtaining access to it; and this
goes to show not only that the structure and nature
of the granary chamber is not sufficient of itself to
prevent germination, but also that the presence of the
ants is essential to secure the dormant condition of
the seeds.</p>

<p>I discovered in two places portions of distinct nests
of <i>Atta structor</i> which had been isolated owing to the
destruction of the terrace-wall behind which they lay,
and there the granaries were filled up and literally
choked with growing seeds, though the earth in
which they lay completely enclosed and concealed
them, until by chance I laid them bare! In one case
I knew that the destruction of the wall had only
taken place ten days before, so that the seeds had
sprouted in this interval.</p>

<p>My experiments also tend to confirm this, and to
favour the belief that the non-germination of the
seeds is due to some direct influence voluntarily exercised
by the ants, and not merely to the conditions
found in the nest, or to acid vapours which in certain
cases are given off by the ants themselves.</p>

<p>In order to put this latter point to the test of
experiment, I confined about a hundred harvesting
ants (<i>A. structor</i>), with their queen and several larv√¶,
in a glass test-tube eight inches long and one inch in
diameter, closed with a cork and filled up to within
about an inch of the cork with damp sandy soil, most
of which was taken from the ants' nest.</p>

<p>I added six peas, six cress and six millet, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[ 173 ]</a></span>
kept the tube tightly corked for nine days, only once
removing the cork for a few seconds in order to
sprinkle a little water on the ants, which were evidently
in need of it. On the ninth day I turned out
the contents of the tube and found that all the peas,
millet and cress, had germinated and were growing
strongly. One of the cress, however, had had its
root, which lay across the gallery constructed by
the ants, gnawed off; four clover seeds, which had
come with the soil taken from the nest, and which
had formed part of the ants' stores, had germinated
also. Here the small quantity of air contained
in the test-tube must certainly have become saturated
with any vapour which the ants may be supposed
to give off, and we cannot therefore accept this
as the cause of the dormant condition of the granary
seeds.</p>

<p>I made other experiments in which harvesting ants
were imprisoned along with various seeds in small,
cylindrical, closed vessels containing a little damp
sand. Here the vessels were frequently rolled from
side to side or shaken, during the twenty-two hours
for which the experiment lasted, so as to excite the
ants and make them give off such odours as they
possessed, but no trace of injurious influence was
produced upon the seeds, which germinated and grew
normally afterwards.</p>

<p>At Mr. Darwin's suggestion I made a long series
of experiments with formic acid, in which measured
quantities, pure or diluted, were placed in a watch-glass
on damp sand and surrounded by seeds, the
whole being enclosed in a covered tumbler, so that
the effects produced on the seeds by the vapour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174 ]</a></span>
rising from the acid might be noted. Similar seeds
were sown at the same time and in the same way,
but without the acid, so as to permit of comparison.
These experiments have afforded some interesting
results,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> but do not supply any positive data which
might help us to discover the secret of the ants.
They narrow, indeed, the area in which search can
profitably be made, indicating as they do that the
vapour of formic acid is incapable of rendering the
seeds dormant after the manner of the ants, and
showing, on the contrary, that its influence is always
injurious to the seeds, even when present only in
excessively minute quantities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> I hope shortly to offer these observations, together with another series of a
similar nature in which my friend Mr. J. B. Andrews has taken part, to the
Linnean Society.</p></div>

<p>It appears to me now that the most promising
field for experiments made with a view to clearing up
this difficulty, is that afforded by the closer investigation
of the phenomena of normal germination, and
by a study of the conditions under which seeds
remain dormant, as they are occasionally known to
do, in situations which our general experience would
have selected as favourable to germination.</p>

<p>I have good hopes, also, that when we come
to know more of the habits of harvesting ants in
tropical countries, and when naturalists have excavated
and described their subterranean stores&mdash;a thing
which has not yet been done as far as I know&mdash;we
may gather fresh indications to guide us in our
search.</p>

<p>I am puzzled to account for the fact, which I have
seen stated by more than one observer in India, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175 ]</a></span>
the ants there have a habit of bringing out large
quantities of grain and seed and laying them in heaps
outside their nests at the commencement of the wet
season. Dr. King, the director of the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Calcutta, has told me that when in the
Gwalior territory during the beginning of the rainy
season, he saw heaps of seeds, principally those of a
leguminous plant (<i>Alyssocarpus</i>), piled up round the
entrances to the ants' nests, and that it was precisely
at that time that flocks of a rock-grouse (<i>Pterocles
exustus</i>) first made their appearance. They fed freely
upon the seeds, and Dr. King found the crops of
some of these birds, which he had shot, filled with
them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine why these Indian ants
should turn out from their nests the very seeds which
it had cost them so much labour to collect, and the
more so as we find that these seeds are devoured by
birds. It seems just possible, however, that the ants,
remaining torpid during the rainy season, do not
require the seeds, and know that, under these circumstances,
if left in the nest, they would sprout,
and choke up the galleries and granaries. Perhaps
also they may have learned that a certain number of
the ejected seeds will spring up and afford future
harvests within easy reach of the nest.</p>

<p>All this, however, and especially the suggestion as
to the dormant condition of the ants during the rainy
season, might easily be proved or disproved by direct
observation; and at present we have nothing but
mere speculation to go upon.</p>

<p>It is curious to find that the native population in a
certain part of India pay a kind of tribute to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176 ]</a></span>
ants, for Dr. King informs me that the Hindoos in
Rajputana, a province in which the old traditions and
superstitions retain especial hold, have a custom of
scattering dry rice and sugar for the ants, and thus
apparently recognise both their love of sweet things
and their habit of collecting seeds. It may be that
this custom is now little more than a meaningless
rite; but in the past it probably had its origin, either
in a wish to propitiate the good will and avert the
destructive attacks of creatures which are the scourge
and dread of entire districts, or in a sentiment of
combined fear and admiration&mdash;fear of the power,
and admiration of the energy, forethought, perseverance,
and sense of duty to the community displayed
by these marvellous insects.</p>

<p>That the latter feeling may have had some share in
prompting this act is suggested by another custom
which is stated<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> to prevail in Arabia, in accordance
with which an ant is placed in the hand of a newly-born
child, in order that its virtues may pass into
and possess the infant.</p>

vol. iv. p. 339, where he quotes from a local dictionary.</p></div>

<p>Among the many curious and obscure features in
the economy of ants, one of the most interesting is
the occasional presence in their nests of different
creatures which live among and often in harmony
with them, the nature of the relations between host
and guest being for the most part quite unknown.</p>

<p>When examining the contents of some granaries
from an extensive nest of <i>Atta structor</i> at Mentone
last spring (1874), I found large numbers of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[ 177 ]</a></span>
minute, shining-brown beetle moving about among
the seeds. These little creatures were themselves not
unlike some very small seeds, and were of an elliptic
form, measuring a trifle less than one line in length.
They proved to belong to the scarce and very restricted
genus <i>Coluocera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> This species, named by
Kraatz <i>C. att√¶</i>, on account of its inhabiting the nests
of ants belonging to the genus <i>Atta</i>, has been found
in Greece.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_118" id="Footnote_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> I am indebted to Mr. F. Smith of the British Museum for the name of this
beetle and for the following reference to its description; Kraatz in <i>Berliner
Entomologische Zeitschrift</i> for 1858-9, p. 140.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Bates,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> in his most interesting account of his
travels on the Amazons, remarks upon the singular
fact, of which the above instance is an example:
"that some of the most anomalous forms of Coleopterous
insects are those which live solely in the nests of
ants," and he then goes on to allude to the strange
snake <i>Amphisb√¶na</i>, a native of that region, which also
lives in the nests of the Sauba ants (<i>&#338;codoma cephalotes</i>),
observing how curious it is that an abnormal
form of snakes should be found in the society of these
insects. He is of opinion, however, that the <i>Amphisb√¶na</i>
is not an inoffensive guest, but lives upon the
ants whose nest it selects for its home.</p>

<p>Another remarkable inhabitant of ants' nests is a
minute cricket, of which I found a single example in
the midst of a colony of black ants at Mentone in
February, 1874. This miniature cricket is scarcely
as large as a grain of wheat, the body, excluding the
antenn√¶ and other appendages, measuring only two
lines in length. It has been described by Dr. Paolo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178 ]</a></span>
Savi<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> under the name of <i>Gryllus myrmecophilus</i>. He
detected it in the nests of several species of ants in
Tuscany, where it lived on the best terms with its
hosts, playing round their nests in warm, and retiring
into them in stormy weather, while allowing the
ants to carry it from place to place during their
migrations.</p>

<i>Bibliotheco Italiana</i>, tom. xv. p. 217.</p></div>

<p><i>Gryllus myrmecophilus</i> has also been observed in
nests of the turf ant (<i>Tetramorium c√¶spitum</i>) near
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>At Mentone I have never found more than this
one specimen, and the ants among which it was
domiciliated were of a species new to me (<i>Camponotus</i>
(<i>Formica</i>) <i>lateralis</i>, Oliv.). This colony of ants was
composed of many winged males and females, as well
as workers, the last-named measuring from two and a
half to three lines in length, and black in colour. In
other colonies I have found the workers black, with
red head and thorax.</p>

<p>Another ant, not enumerated in my list in <i>Ants
and Spiders</i>, is <i>Camponotus</i> (<i>Formica</i>) <i>sylvatica</i>, which
I detected in March last under stones on Cap Martin,
near Mentone. When disturbed, this ant runs along
with its abdomen raised vertically in the air, much as
the devil's coachhorse (<i>Staphylinus</i>) does. The same
curious habit of erecting the abdomen is found in
another ant, not uncommon in decaying wood in the
South, <i>Crematogaster scutellaris</i>; and probably all
three insects adopt this threatening attitude, which is
that of the scorpion preparing to strike and sting, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[ 179 ]</a></span>
order to intimidate their enemies, though <i>Crematogaster</i>
is the only one which really possesses a sting.</p>

<p><i>Camponotus sylvatica</i> has the same long legs and
slender body as <i>Formica cursor</i>, and is of about the
same size; the workers, which are of a dark brown
colour, measuring about 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines in length.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be well, in concluding these remarks
on Harvesting Ants, to call attention to the
principal questions which still await solution. The
first is one which any observer who travels in Central
Europe during the summer may help to solve.</p>

<p>1. Do <i>any</i> ants collect and store seed in Switzerland,
Germany, North France, England, or indeed in
any of the colder parts of the world?</p>

<p>2. What are the habits of <i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A.
barbara</i> when living, as they are known to do, in
Switzerland, Germany, and Northern France?</p>

<p>3. How do the ants contrive to preserve the seeds
in their granaries free from germination and decay?</p>

<p>4. How are the seed-stores of tropical ants disposed
below ground, and of what do they consist?</p>

<p>5. Do harvesting ants exist in the southern states
of North America, in Australia, New Zealand, or at
the Cape?</p>

TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS.</h1>


<p>There would doubtless be a just feeling of pride and
satisfaction in the heart of a naturalist who could say
that he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with
all the species of a particular group of animals, had
learned their most secret habits, and mastered their
several relations to the objects, animate and inanimate,
which surrounded them. But perhaps a still
keener pleasure is enjoyed by one who carries about
with him some problem of the kind but partially
solved, and who, holding in his hand the clue which
shall guide him onwards, sees in each new place that
he visits fresh opportunities of discovery. The latter
is certainly the condition of those who take an interest
in searching out the habits and characters of trap-door
spiders; for this subject, far from being exhausted,
expands under the light of recently acquired facts,
and invites research in many parts of Europe, north
as well as south.</p>

<p>We have only to compare the number of types of
trap-door nest which were known before the publication
of <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, with those at present recorded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[ 181 ]</a></span>
to see how fruitful this field of inquiry has
already proved.</p>

<p>Before this little work was published, only one
type of trap-door nest was known in Europe: two
new types were described in its pages, and I have
now the pleasure of being able to bring three more
hitherto unknown European types before the notice
of my readers, thus raising the number to six in all.
I do not include in these six types the very curious,
and still imperfectly-known nest of <i>Atypus</i>;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> a spider
which is a true representative of the trap-door group
as far as its structural characters are concerned, but
which, although it excavates a silk-lined burrow in
the earth, does not appear to construct any kind of
door at the mouth of its tube.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_122" id="Footnote_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122"><span class="label">[122]</span></a> See <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, page 78. <i>Atypus</i> belongs to the sub-family <i>Atypin√¶</i>,
a division which does not include any of the <i>Nemesias</i> or <i>Ctenizas</i>, and of
which indeed <i>Atypus</i> is the only European representative.</p></div>

<p>Much uncertainty still hangs over the habits of
this spider, as the facts hitherto recorded, though
perfectly authentic, are difficult to piece together into
a satisfactory whole. One thing, however, is clear,
and that is, that the nests and habits of the spiders
of the genus <i>Atypus</i> (of which, as Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
informs me, two if not three distinct
species inhabit England) merit attentive study, and
would most certainly repay it. Hastings, Portland,
the coast of Dorsetshire, and the neighbourhood of
London and Exeter, are the habitats hitherto cited
for this spider, but I cannot doubt its existence in
many sheltered localities on the south coast of
England.</p>

<p>The most recent contribution to our knowledge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[ 182 ]</a></span>
this genus is contained in a paper by M. Eug√®ne
Simon,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> who describes three species (two of which are
new), as inhabiting France, and it remains to be
ascertained whether our British <i>Atypi</i> agree in their
characters with any of these.</p>

Entomologique de France, 5<sup>e</sup> ser. tom. iii. (1873), p. 109.</p></div>

<p>He describes (p. 113-4) the nest and mode of life
of <i>Atypus piceus</i>, Sulzer (=<i>A. Sulzeri</i>, Latr.),<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> the
commonest of the three species, as follows:&mdash;"They
(the spiders) seek dry and somewhat sandy slopes,
sometimes also woods, chiefly plantations of evergreens;
their retreat is always concealed either by
stones, or in moss which one must remove carefully
and in large masses (<i>pl√¢ques</i>) in order to detect
them."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_124" id="Footnote_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_124"><span class="label">[124]</span></a> Thus named by M. Simon.</p></div>

<p>"This Atypus excavates an oblique hole of 15 to 20
centimetres deep, and of the size of its body; it lines
it with a rather narrow silken tube of a very close
texture, the upper part of which, exceeding the subterranean
portion in length, lies horizontally on the
surface of the ground, and ends in an open tapering
point. Near its lower extremity the tube is suddenly
contracted, and then dilates into the form of a fairly
spacious apartment, in which the spider lives; the
cocoon enclosing the eggs is suspended by a few
threads at the contraction. I have frequently surprised
<i>Atypus</i> in the act of holding earth-worms in
their falces, and I think that these Annelids constitute
the larger part of their food; indeed, if one
examines the lower portion of the silk chamber, one
may remark a part where the tissue is thinner and
more transparent. I have not been able to detect an
opening, but it is probable that the <i>Atypus</i> can easily
part the not very compact threads, and thus obtain
for itself an easy prey, and dispense with the necessity
of ascending to the surface of the ground. When
taken out of its tube, <i>Atypus</i> does not even attempt to
escape; it is therefore plain that it is not organized
for the pursuit of an active prey; and, on the other
hand, the upper extremity of the tube is ill-adapted
for an ambuscade, being almost closed, and without
support. This small opening would seem to be solely
intended for the entrance and exit of the male (a very
much smaller creature than the female) during the
breeding season, which occurs in the month of
October."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183 ]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Simon says that this species of <i>Atypus</i> is
common in all the centre, east and west of France,
and that he has detected it in great abundance in the
neighbourhood of Troyes, in Champagne, in the
month of October, when the male was inhabiting the
same tube with the female.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> I am greatly indebted
to M. Simon for having given me the specimen of a
silk tube taken entire from a nest found in this
locality, which I have figured in <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, fig. A. It
will be seen that the tube has collapsed, but one may
still trace the enlargement near the base which forms
the chamber, the elbow where it is bent at the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184 ]</a></span>
of the ground, the moss, scales, and fibres of plants
which are woven into, and serve to conceal the a√´rial
portion, and its termination in a twisted and apparently-closed
mouth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_125" id="Footnote_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> M. Simon has discovered another species of <i>Atypus</i> at Digne in the
Basses Alpes which constructs a similar nest to that described above. This
species was detected for the first time by M. Simon and described by him under
the name of <i>Atypus bleodonticus</i>.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, I believe that, in this specimen, the upper
extremity of the tube is really closed, for, when I
succeeded in inflating this a√´rial portion, the lips did
not part, but remained drawn together.</p>

<p>It seems very extraordinary that the mouth of the
tube should be thus closed, so that the female spider
becomes a prisoner, self-immured, and I can only
suppose that this is a temporary condition, limited
perhaps to the period during which she receives the
visits of the male.</p>

<p>At the very base of the tube I found a mass of
earth, roots and vegetable fibres, and in this I hoped
to have detected the <i>d√©bris</i> of insects or other food,
such as I sometimes find at the bottom of and below
the tubes of the trap-door nests in the South, but of
this there was no trace.</p>

<p>It is difficult to me to imagine how the spider
could contrive to live by the capture of worms, after
the fashion suggested by M. Simon; for who does
not know the speed with which, on the slightest
alarm, worms draw back into their holes and escape
pursuit, and the muscular power which they exert
in resisting any attempts to drag them out of the
earth?</p>

<p>M. Simon's account of the closed tube and capture
of worms by this spider corresponds, however, with
that given by Mr. Joshua Brown, the first discoverer
of <i>Atypus</i> in England.</p>

<p>This gentleman communicated his discovery to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185 ]</a></span>
Edward Newman<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> in 1856, since which time (with
the exception of M. Simon's paper quoted above)
little or nothing seems to have been done to clear up
the points which remain doubtful in the history of
these singular creatures.</p>

<p>Several nests of <i>Atypus</i> were discovered by Mr.
Joshua Brown in the neighbourhood of Hastings,
when traversing a lane bounded on either side by
high and steep sand-banks, partially covered with
grass and bushes.</p>

<p>His attention was at first arrested by the sight of
"something hanging down which looked like the
cocoon of some moth;" but, on closer examination,
the silk case proved to be empty, and was continued
as a tube into the ground to a depth of 9 inches,
where he came upon the spider lying at the bottom.
Further research revealed the existence of a number
of these nests in the same locality, but the length of
the different tubes varied much; they were usually
about 9 inches long, but some were much longer,
often baffling his attempts to follow them; the longest
which he was able to secure entire measured 11 inches.
All the nests were, however, alike in having a tubular
silk lining, about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch in diameter, a part of
which protruded from the ground for about 2 inches,
and was pendent, inflated, and covered with particles
of sand, assimilating it to the surrounding surface; it
was closed at the upper extremity, leaving no exit to
the open air.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown took home some of these tubes in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186 ]</a></span>
collapsed state with the spider at the bottom. In
one case, on opening the box in which the nest was
placed, he perceived a movement throughout the tube,
as if it were being inflated; this however soon subsided,
but the following morning he was surprised to
see that the whole tube was inflated, especially at the
end which had lain exposed on the bank. He failed
to find any aperture by which the spider could enter
or leave her nest, and his captives, though passing
backwards and forwards in their tubes, never came
out at either end. He never saw flies or any fragments
of insects in the nests; but, on drawing out one of
the tubes, he observed a worm at the lower end, partially
within it, partially outside, and he perceived
that the spider had evidently been eating a considerable
portion of its anterior extremity.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that there are some discrepancies
between the different accounts which have
been given of the nests of <i>Atypus</i> found in England
and France,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> and I think it quite probable that some
at least of the nests described may really differ, and
be the work of distinct species belonging to this
genus. Mr. Brown describes his nests as having by
far the greater part of their length under ground,
while in those observed by M. Simon, as shown in
my figure, <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a> fig. A, the exposed portion of
the tube equalled or exceeded the subterranean.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_127" id="Footnote_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_127"><span class="label">[127]</span></a> A subject already alluded to in <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, at p. 78.</p></div>

<p>An imperfect specimen at the British Museum,
from some English station (exact habitat not given),
appears to have the proportions described by Mr.
Brown; the length of the a√´rial portion of the tube
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187 ]</a></span>
being less than one-fourth of that of the subterranean;
the upper end of the tube is however open, but I am
doubtful whether this was originally so or not, for
the silk is torn at this point, and the opening may be
a rent caused by rough handling.</p>

<p>After a comparison of the above description, it
appears to me that the following are the principal
points which remain to be cleared up:</p>

<p>1. What is the precise structure of the nests of
Atypus, and are they always uniform in character at
all seasons of the year?</p>

<p>2. What is the use of the exposed a√´rial portion
of the tube?</p>

<p>3. Do the two British species make similar nests?</p>

<p>4. What food, besides worms, does the female live
upon, and how does she obtain it?</p>

<p>5. Does she ever leave the nest?</p>

<p>6. What becomes of these spiders and their nests
in the winter, and how long do they live?</p>

<p>7. When do the young leave the nest; and do they,
like their relatives in the South, construct nests like
those of their parents in miniature?</p>

<p>I would commend all these points to any lover
of Nature who may seek the southern coasts of
England during the autumn and winter months,
and I think it more than likely that a careful search
in the sandy banks near St. Leonards, the slopes
under the fir-woods of Bournemouth, and the deep
lanes in the neighbourhood of Torquay, would be
rewarded with success.</p>

<p>If the breeding season in England only commences
in October, as appears to be the case in France, it
would seem most probable that the spiders survive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188 ]</a></span>
the winter. Very possibly these spiders and their
nests might be transplanted and placed for observation
in a garden; and if room were granted them in
a greenhouse or Wardian case, or even in a large
flower-pot in a living-room, it is not unlikely that
the warmer temperature might waken them up to
renewed activity.</p>

<p>It seems clear that <i>Atypus</i> has to fear the insidious
attacks of enemies; for not only is the external portion
of the tube closed or almost closed at certain seasons,
but it is covered outside with such materials as may
serve to make it resemble the surrounding surface of
the ground. Thus Mr. Brown's nests, lying on a
sandy bank, were covered with particles of sand, while
my specimen from Troyes has moss and fibres of plants
woven into its upper extremity.</p>

<p>Indeed, all the European representatives of the suborder
<i>Territelari√¶</i> which I have myself met with,
conceal their nests with great care and skill. There
appear to be others, however, which either make no
nests at all but hide under stones, or only construct
a simple silk tube, open at the mouth, and without any
special contrivance for its dissimulation. Further
observation of the habits and dwellings of these apparently
unworthy members of the trap-door group
is much to be desired.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> in his work on the Amazons, describes
<i>Mygale (Theraphosa) Blondii</i>, a large and powerful
spider of that region, as burrowing into the earth
and "forming a broad slanting gallery about three
feet long, the sides of which he lines beautifully with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189 ]</a></span>
silk." This spider "is nocturnal in his habits," and
maybe seen "just before sunset keeping watch within
the mouth of his tunnel, disappearing suddenly when
he hears a heavy foot-tread near his hiding place."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_128" id="Footnote_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128"><span class="label">[128]</span></a> Bates, H. W., <i>Naturalist on the Amazons</i>, Ed. 2. (1864).</p></div>

<p>This nest would therefore appear to have an open
tube undefended by any door; but in this case the
great size of the spider and the depth of the burrow,
which is more than twice as long as that of the
average European nests, may help to explain this
apparent want of precaution.</p>

<p>But, if we wish to learn with what different materials
and by what varied means the same end of self-preservation
can be attained, we have only to cast a
glance at the sketch of a portion of a nest at fig. B,
<a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, p. 183, where it will be seen that the
entrance to the nest, far from being concealed or
obscured in any way, is rendered a most striking
object, and one which appears devised for the very
purpose of attracting attention. The nest to which I
refer is the work of <i>Cyrtauchenius elongatus</i>, from Morocco,
and consists, according to the account given me
by its discoverer, M. Simon, of a deep cylindrical
burrow in the soil, the silk lining of which is prolonged
upwards for about three inches above the surface of
the ground, and enlarged into a funnel shape, so that
it becomes from two to three inches across at the
orifice. This a√´rial portion being snow-white, at once
attracts the eye even from a considerable distance, and
the nests rising up amid the sparse grasses and other
small plants which serve to support but not to conceal
them, present the appearance of scattered white fungi.</p>

<p>This is therefore quite a new type among the nests
constructed by trap-door spiders, new in form and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190 ]</a></span>
probably in function also, and I would propose to
distinguish it provisionally as the <i>funnel type</i>.</p>

<p>Now the female <i>Cyrtauchenius</i> is, like its near relatives
the <i>Nemesias</i>, a sluggish and rather helpless
creature, and shows no apparent physical superiority
which might countenance its dispensing with the
methods of concealment which form the characteristic
habit of the group.</p>

<p>How then does this spider manage to escape its
many enemies, especially the insidious attacks of
the insects of the <i>Sphex</i> and <i>Ichneumon</i> families, which
certainly abound in Morocco?</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, to whom I put the question, suggested
that this species may perhaps be chiefly nocturnal in
its habits, and that, if this is the case, the bright
white and flower-like tube of the nest may possibly
serve to attract night flying insects, which would thus
become its prey.</p>

<p>In any case, whether we can discover them or not,
some curious points of difference must exist between
this spider and its allies, which secure to it a comparative
immunity.</p>

<p>It appears to me that there are few questions
which can be of greater interest to the naturalist
than those which have to do with the conditions determining
the existence of a given species in a given
place.</p>

<p>Of the questions, Who are your relatives? Where
do they live? and How are you able to live here?
surely the last is not the least important.</p>

<p>And, if we wish to try to answer this question, we
must do all in our power to find out how the habits
and conditions of life of the creature in question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[ 191 ]</a></span>
differ from those of its competitors; for we may be
quite certain that it does not exist where we see it
by grace and favour, but by merit; if it is neither
stronger, cleverer nor more numerous than its neighbours,
we may be sure that it has found some means
of living which does not interfere fatally with their
requirements. Hence the endless diversity of function
and habits in all living creatures, which forms such a
prolific and marvellous subject for our study and contemplation.</p>

<p>I am indebted to M. Simon for permission to
publish the details given above on <i>Cyrtauchenius
elongatus</i>, and also for having given me such directions
as enabled me to make the sketch from which the
drawing at <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, fig. B, was copied.</p>

<p>I must however state that this illustration is not
taken from an actual specimen, but is prepared solely
from his description; so that it cannot pretend to
complete accuracy of detail. M. Simon assured me
nevertheless that it conveyed the general appearance
of this remarkable nest with sufficient fidelity, and I
have been induced to reproduce it here in the hope
that it may serve to make my meaning plainer, and to
suggest the kind of object which one should look
for, if an opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Another species of the same genus, <i>Cyrtauchenius
Doleschallii</i>, is known to inhabit Sicily, but the nest is
undescribed. M. Lucas has described two species,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
belonging to the closely-allied genus <i>Cyrtocephalus</i>,
both of which appear to construct nests somewhat
similar in form to that discovered by M. Simon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192 ]</a></span>
Whether these nests are equally showy we cannot
tell, as the account is brief and few details are given;
but one, that of <i>Cyrtocephalus terricola</i>, appears to
differ in having threads stretched from the opening
of its funnel, which serve to ensnare insects and to
give notice of these captures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_129" id="Footnote_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129"><span class="label">[129]</span></a> <i>Cyrtocephalus Walckena√´ri</i> and <i>terricola</i>, Lucas (H.), <i>Animaux articul√©s
de l'Alg√©rie</i> (Paris, 1847-9), vol. i. p. 94-5.</p></div>

<p>The great trap-door group therefore comprises
spiders which differ widely in respect of their dwelling
places. Some construct no nest at all or only an
irregular web, and live under stones; others, like
<i>Theraphosa Blondii</i>, make a simple cylindrical tunnel,
or, like those just described, a tube having a prolonged,
uncovered, funnel-shaped mouth: others
again, belonging to the genus <i>Atypus</i>, form the
curious and as yet imperfectly-understood nests with a
silken tubular lining, part of which hangs down outside;
while on the highest rung of the architectural
ladder, stand the builders of the veritable trap-door
nests.</p>

<p>It seems quite possible that, when we know more
of the structures made by <i>Territelari√¶</i> generally in
various parts of the world, we shall find that nests of
various degrees of complexity and perfection of
structure exist, bridging over the gulf between the
barbarous dwellers under stones and the highly civilized
inhabitants of the branched wafer and cork
nests.</p>

<p>Indeed, thanks to recent discoveries, I am already
able to do something of this kind for one small group
of spiders, namely, for that of the European <i>Nemesias</i>
having nests with wafer doors.</p>

<div id="Plate_XIV" class="fig_center" style="width: 601px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XIV.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate14lg.png"><img src="images/plate14.png" width="601" height="408" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[ 193 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope to make this plain by reference to the
diagrams on <a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>, where the figures C, D, E, F,
and G represent on a reduced scale five types of wafer
nest constructed by as many distinct spiders, and
where a gradation may readily be traced between the
simplest type at C and the most complicated at G; but
we shall speak more fully of this matter by-and-by.</p>

<p>In these diagrams I have placed that representing
the nest of <i>Atypus</i> on the extreme left (A);<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> next to
this stands that of a nest of the cork type (B), a
type which must be carefully distinguished from all
the rest. It must not be supposed that the solid
cork door (so called from its resemblance to a short
cork closing the neck of a bottle), is nothing more
than a thicker edition of the wafer door; it is not so,
but, on the contrary, possesses a very characteristic
structure of its own, being composed of many layers
of silk, each furnished with a sloping rim of earth,
while the wafer door consists of but a single layer of
silk.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_130" id="Footnote_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> These types may be briefly enumerated as follows:</p>

<table summary="data">

</tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>I have represented at B 1 the 14 layers of silk
and earth which went to make a single cork door
examined by me. It will be seen that the outermost
of these layers is the largest, and the innermost the
smallest, and I have already (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 150)
shown reason for believing that the latter constituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[ 194 ]</a></span>
the first door the spider ever made, and that the consecutive
layers mark successive stages in the enlargement
of the nest.</p>

<p>There is therefore a broad distinction as to construction
between cork nests and wafer nests; moreover,
while the former are, as far as we know at
present, all of one type, and only differ in size or
proportion, the latter appear under five distinct types.</p>

<p>Thus, every known cork nest, whether found in
Europe, America, or the Antipodes, has the same
solid door and simple tube; while of the wafer nests,
some have branched and others simple tubes, and
some again possess a lower door in addition to the
upper or surface door.</p>

<p>In the following pages I intend to treat of the
trap-door spiders and their nests in the same order in
which the latter are placed in the diagram, commencing
with those of the cork type B, and then
dealing successively with the several wafer nests from
C to G. We have already spoken of A, the nest of
<i>Atypus piceus</i>, and seen that our present knowledge of
this nest, of the habits of its occupant and of those of
its relations, is still far from complete.</p>

<p>The cork type is, as my readers will perhaps remember,
the great cosmopolitan type which ranges
round the world, and which, curious to say, is built by
many different spiders belonging to distinct genera.</p>

<p>The idea of planning this very perfect bit of mechanism
appears to be the common inheritance of
these several spiders, separated though they are by
wide intervals of geographical space as well as to
structural divergence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[ 195 ]</a></span></p>

<p>At Mentone two distinct spiders construct nests of
the cork type, one of these being a <i>Nemesia</i> and the
other a <i>Cteniza</i>. They are as unlike each other as
they well can be, and it seems remarkably strange
that their nest-building instinct should be so similar.
The nest of the <i>Cteniza</i> is indeed shallower than that
of the <i>Nemesia</i>, and a practised eye can usually trace
a difference between the slightly less angular lower
surface and more semi-circular outline of the door of
the former, and the more abruptly bevelled and more
circular door of the latter.</p>

<p>These spiders and their nests have been already
described and figured in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> under the
names of <i>Ct. fodiens</i> and <i>Nemesia c√¶mentaria</i>. Recent
discoveries have however shown that these spiders
possess distinctive characters of their own, and, though
closely allied to the species indicated, should be separated
from them.</p>

<p>Last spring when pulling down an old terrace-wall
(by permission) I had the good fortune to discover
the very remarkable male <i>Cteniza</i> drawn at fig. A,
<a href="#Plate_XX">Pl. XX</a>, p. 254. I found no trace of a nest or web of
any kind, and the spider was merely hiding between
the stones.</p>

<p>There appears to be scarcely any doubt that this is
the male of the female Mentonese <i>Cteniza</i> which has,
up to this time, been called <i>Ct. fodiens</i>. A comparison
with typical specimens of the true <i>Ct. fodiens</i> from
Corsica, has however shown that the two are certainly
distinct, and Mr. Pickard-Cambridge<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196 ]</a></span>
describes the Mentonese form under the name of <i>Ct.
Moggridgii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_131" id="Footnote_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> Mr. Pickard-Cambridge has once more kindly undertaken the task of
naming and describing my collections of trap-door spiders, and the results of
his labours will be found at the end of the present work.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_132" id="Footnote_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> I take this opportunity of thanking him for the compliment. A description
of this new species will be found at p. 254, below.</p></div>

<p>The females of the true <i>Cteniza fodiens</i> are far larger
than those of our new Mentonese species, and construct
their nests in dry and exposed places, instead
of in the moist and shady ivy-covered banks selected
by the latter. I have found <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i> at
San Remo and Mentone, and it will probably be also
discovered at Nice, but I failed to detect it either at
Cannes or Hy√®res.</p>

<p>The Corsican male at the first glance curiously resembles
that found at Mentone, but differs essentially
in details and especially in having the surface of
the caput unbroken, whereas the caput of the
latter presents a very peculiar character in an
impressed line which runs across it from side to side
(figs. A 1 and A 2). Both agree, however, in being
strangely unlike their females.</p>

<p>The other builder of a nest of the cork type at
Mentone was, as has been already stated, described
and figured in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> under the name of
<i>Nemesia c√¶mentaria</i>. Now the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> of
Latreille is found at Montpellier, the classical habitat
where the first discovery of trap-door spiders in
Europe was made towards the end of the last century,
but its true characters have been hitherto but imperfectly
known.</p>

<p>I have lately been able to secure several specimens
at this place, and they certainly differed in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[ 197 ]</a></span>
markings from the so-called <i>c√¶mentaria</i> of Mentone.
M. Simon had previously informed me that he considered
our Mentonese spider distinct from the typical
<i>c√¶mentaria</i>, and had kindly proposed to give my
name to the Mentonese species; and now Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
on the receipt of the specimens collected
by me at Montpellier, coincides with M. Simon, and
adopts his nomenclature, calling the Mentonese
<i>Nemesia N. Moggridgii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_133" id="Footnote_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> See below, p. 273.</p></div>

<p>I found but one nest of the cork type at Montpellier,
where it was most abundant, and invariably
inhabited by the same spider, so that there can be
little doubt that this is the celebrated <i>Nemesia c√¶mentaria</i>
of Latreille, the nests of which were described
by the Abb√© Sauvages in 1763.</p>

<p>When living, the pattern on the abdomen is far
more distinct and is traced on a paler ground than in
<i>N. Moggridgii</i>, and the patterns on the back of the
caput, as seen in specimens preserved in spirits, and
the relative sizes of the lateral eyes, as well as other
details enumerated by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge, afford
characters by which they may be known apart; and
it is probable that when the males, which are at
present unknown, shall be discovered, they will be
found to present other distinctive peculiarities. In
the present instance we have the reverse of the
case described above, in which two very distinct
spiders constructed a similar nest, for here both
spiders and nests are much alike.</p>

<p>We have yet to learn what are the special advantages
which each type of nest affords; but it is plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[ 198 ]</a></span>
from the fact of the same type being adopted indifferently
by both nearly- and most distantly-related
spiders, that the form of the nest is governed far
more by the conditions which it is contrived to meet,
than by the affinity or resemblance of the spiders
which construct it.</p>

<p>I have found <i>N. Moggridgii</i> at San Remo, Mentone,
Cannes, Hy√®res, and Marseilles, but thus far, I only
know of the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> at Montpellier.</p>

<p>The latter spider is rather bolder than the former,
and I frequently saw it at Montpellier watching at
the slightly raised door, with the tips of the claws
projecting from the nest, and it rarely failed to
resist most vigorously any attempt of mine to force
the door open.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1873, I received two specimens
of trap-door nests from California. Both of
these nests were of the cork type and nearly entire,
wanting only a small portion of the base of the tube;
they most closely resembled one another and were
probably the work of the same spider. For one
of these, coming from the San Joaquin valley,
between the Calaveras and the Tejon, I have to
thank M. J. C. Puls, a Belgian entomologist residing
at Ghent; and for the other, containing the spider
which had constructed it <i>alive within its tube</i> (!), I
am indebted to Mr. G. H. Treadwell of San Francisco.
The former nest is drawn at fig. A, <a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>, and
the spider<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> from the latter at fig. B of the same

<p>Mr. Treadwell had carried this spider and its nest,
with the block of earth in which it lay, all the way
from Visalia, a town about 350 miles south of San
Francisco, where he had taken it; the nest and spider
travelled safe to London enclosed in an empty cocoatina
tin, 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches deep, and 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> across.</p>

<p>The nest was then entire, for these spiders appear
to make singularly shallow tubes; and it might have
remained so up to the present day had it not been
for the rash curiosity of a chambermaid in the London
hotel where Mr. Treadwell was staying, who, smitten
with a great desire to learn what the heavy little box
which came from the land of gold might contain,
proceeded to examine the earth, when the sudden
appearance of the spider frightened her so much that
box and nest and all were thrown with a crash upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Were it not for this unlucky incident I might have
seen a complete specimen of this curious nest; but as
it was, though the spider miraculously escaped uninjured,
the bottom of the nest was pounded into dust,
and only the upper portion remained intact.</p>

<p>Both this nest and that sent to me by M. Puls,
were of the true cork type, and presented a solid door
with a bevelled edge, fitting into the correspondingly
bevelled lip of the tube, and shutting flush with
the surface of the ground. The lining of the tube
was strong and thick, but soft and silky to the
touch.</p>

<p>The tube itself in Mr. Treadwell's specimen, when
intact, cannot have measured more than 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in
length; and we learn from Dr. Lanzwert, who collected
the other specimen, that the average length of
these nests does not exceed three inches. Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[ 200 ]</a></span>
Lanzwert, writing in one of the local papers<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> of "The
Mygales or Ground Spiders," says, "the poisonous
black tarantulas, so well known to naturalists, are
extremely common in California, but only in places
upland, or lowland which are very hot and dry.
Their principal haunts are the San Joaquin valley,
between the Calaveras and the Tejon. A similar
species from the coast is not only smaller than the interior
variety, but the colours are much deeper.
They both make a curious habitation under the
ground, composed of a glutinized, web-worked purse,
about three inches long, and which is furnished with
a tightly-fitting lid which they can open or shut at
pleasure, and which is as cunning a piece of insect
architecture as is to be found in nature. These ugly
loathsome Californian spiders are often mentioned by
thoughtless scribes as carrying no more danger than
a common wasp, like the species of Italy, but it is
well known that several persons, young and old, have
lost their lives in this State from the bite of such
tarantulas as are met with in our coast and interior
country. Their enemy in the Tulare valley is an
immense shining black wasp,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> fully an inch long,
which will pounce upon them, and after a short
battle drag the tarantula along in the most valiant
style of heroic conquest. These interior tarantulas
are often seen measuring two inches in the
spread."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_136" id="Footnote_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> This insect was probably not a true wasp, though belonging to an allied
family; it may perhaps have been a <i>Pepsis</i>, certain species of which genus
Mr. Bates informs me he has frequently seen near Santarem on the Amazon,
hawking over the ground where the huge trap-door spiders lived, and suddenly
pouncing down upon one of these creatures, often many times larger than
themselves, when, after paralysing their victim with their sting, they would
deliberately saw off the legs before dragging away the bodies!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[ 201 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Mr. Treadwell was quite as much impressed as Dr.
Lanzwert with the belief that the bite of these spiders
is fatal, but it does not appear that either of these
gentlemen have obtained conclusive evidence in support
of this allegation.</p>

<p>I have occasionally been bitten by the trap-door
spiders in South France, but have never experienced
the slightest subsequent inconvenience, nor was
there any trace of inflammation or poisoning about
the punctures which they made. Mr. Blackwall<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>
has made a very careful set of observations on this
head, and has caused some of the largest species of
British spiders to bite his finger and wrist until the
blood flowed, without the slightest ill effects. He also
inoculated himself at the same time with the poisonous
secretion of the spider and with that of the wasp;
when the latter wound became extremely painful,
while the former was not perceptibly aggravated.
Mr. Blackwall obtained the spiders' poison by causing
a spider to seize a slip of clean glass with its mandibles,
when a small quantity of a liquid showing a slightly
acid reaction was deposited.</p>

Poison of the Araneidea," pp. 240-256.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Treadwell informed me that these Californian
trap-door spiders leave their nests in the daytime,
and may be seen walking by the roadside, though
they are always prepared to hurry back to their nests
on the approach of danger.</p>

<p>I received the spider which I have represented at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[ 202 ]</a></span>
fig. B, <a href="#Plate_XV">Pl. XV</a>, p. 198 (<i>Cteniza Californica</i>), from this
gentleman alive, and still within the remaining portion
of her nest, on the 6th of July, 1873. She then had
the legs and cephalothorax of a brownish-black, and
the abdomen of a dull, uniform, dusky chocolate brown,
but with an indistinct median line near the anterior end
on the upper side, intersected at right angles by a
shorter line. Mr. Treadwell said, however, that when
captured, this spider was much darker, and of a pitchy
black colour. The hairs all over the body were short,
but especially so on the abdomen, which had the appearance
of cloth or felt.</p>

<p>This creature in many ways recalls <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>
of Corsica, and in a less degree the <i>Cteniza</i> of Mentone
and San Remo.</p>

<p>We find not only the same general form of body,
but also the same claws furnished with only one
tooth, instead of many as in <i>Nemesia</i>, and other
distinctive features; and it is interesting to observe
in the nest that the more semi-circular form of the
door and the wider hinge also connect it rather with
<i>Cteniza</i> than with <i>Nemesia</i>.</p>

<p>Here, as in all spiders yet observed in cork nests,
we find the habit of resisting any attempt to open the
door, and many a time when I have wished to raise
the lid in order to drop in flies or other food, I have
been obliged to desist because the bending blade of
my penknife showed that I should injure the nest if
I used greater force.</p>

<p>No doubt the shallowness of the nest is an advantage
to its occupant in one way&mdash;namely, that it
enables the spider to start up at the shortest notice,
and cling on to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[ 203 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It is curious to find that, far as California is removed
from the Riviera, the same habits of construction and
self-defence are common to the spiders of both countries,
and that the bond of kinship sets time and space
at defiance.</p>

<p>I kept this spider all through the summer and early
autumn at Richmond (Surrey), sprinkling the nest
from time to time with water, and constantly supplying
its inhabitant with flies, wood-lice, grasshoppers,
earwigs, and other similar dainties. She did not,
however, seem eager for food, and the insects provided
for her, and actually placed within the nest, were
often turned out again almost untouched.</p>

<p>When I placed living insects, such as grasshoppers,
for example, within the nest over-night, she would
often allow them to remain there unharmed, so that
I found them ready to escape on opening the door
the following morning.</p>

<p>I never saw her leave the nest of her own free
will, and when I made her come out and set her to
run in the garden, she began at once to seek for a
place to hide in, hobbling along in an ungainly way
and at a slow pace.</p>

<p>She must, however, have left the nest on more
than one occasion, unseen by me, for she deposited
several clusters of eggs at various times upon the
under-surface of the gauze net which was fastened over
the mouth of the box in which she was imprisoned.</p>

<p>The first of these groups of eggs was laid during
the night between the 12th and 13th of July, and
formed a raspberry-shaped cluster attached to the gauze.</p>

<p>I have represented this cluster of the natural size
at fig. B, 6, and magnified at fig. B, 7, on <a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[ 204 ]</a></span>
only in an inverted position, for they really hung
downwards from the under side of the net.</p>

<p>These eggs were greyish white or pale brown, and
varied in shape from globose to oblong.</p>

<p>All were very small, the largest only measuring <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
line in its greatest length, but it is doubtful whether
any of these eggs were fertile, and, though they
appeared full and plump, many presented an irregular
and fissured surface.</p>

<p>A fortnight later (July 27) another cluster of eggs
was laid, and this time between the hours of five and
eight <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> When the lamp was brought in at the
latter hour, I perceived what I took to be a drop of
water hanging from the gauze cover above and rather
in front of the spider's door, the very position occupied
by the cluster of eggs previously described.
On closer inspection this proved to be a drop of a
pellucid colourless liquid, in which some thirty eggs
floated. One egg was laid on the gauze at some
distance from the main group, and several were also
attached to the inside of the tin box.</p>

<p>At midnight I found that the drop had coagulated
and contracted, and by the following morning the
mass was quite dry and resembled the former group,
only that it was not quite so convex.</p>

<p>Some of the eggs forming this cluster were much
larger than any in the preceding one, and one
measured as much as a line in length by half a line
in breadth. This group is shown magnified at fig. B, 8,
<a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>, and some of the separate eggs more highly
magnified at fig. B, 9.</p>

<p>Between this date and the end of November when
the spider died, eggs were laid on seven distinct occasions&mdash;viz.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[ 205 ]</a></span>
on July 31, August 11, 15, 31 (when I
again found the eggs floating in a drop of liquid,
having been deposited on the gauze between two and
half-past four o'clock in the afternoon); September 9
(23 eggs laid on the earth near the entrance to the
nest); September 19 (about 30 eggs on the gauze), and
November 4 (about 30 eggs on the gauze).</p>

<p>Thus, between July 13 and November 4, this
spider laid nine clusters of eggs, all but one of which
were placed on the same part of the gauze cover,
above and a little in front of the door, and the total
number of eggs deposited cannot have been less than
250. It is difficult to understand why she should
have laid these eggs outside the nest, unless indeed
she knew them to be sterile, and so treated them as
refuse. I can scarcely believe that such a procedure
is in accordance with the ordinary habits of these
spiders; for, if the eggs and young are habitually
exposed, then the perfect concealment of the nest
would lose one of its most important uses. When we
remember that there are minute hymenopterous
insects which lay their eggs within the eggs of the
spiders, we can see how important it may be that the
entrance to a nest, which is at once nursery and
stronghold, should be closed by a well-fitting door,
and one which may exclude, not only the larger and
more powerful enemies of the full-grown spiders, but
also the tiny and almost imperceptible assailants of
the eggs and young.</p>

<p>This Californian spider was always careful to eject
from the nest the remains of insects with which I
had supplied her, and, as she did so deliberately and
by day as well as by night, I had frequent opportunities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[ 206 ]</a></span>
of watching her. Sometimes, if not alarmed
by any sudden movement, she would remain for one
or two minutes at the mouth of the nest with the
door partly raised, and I was glad to seize these
opportunities for making some experiments, with a
view to learning whether she would prove as sensitive
to sound as she did to other vibrations and to the
sight of moving objects.</p>

<p>Placing myself so that the partly-opened door
screened me from her view, I was able to approach
close to the nest without causing her alarm, and to
make different sounds and noises at distances varying
from three to fourteen inches.</p>

<p>In no case, however, did she pay the slightest
attention; and neither shrill and sudden whistling,
deep chest and buzzing sounds, an octave of piercing
notes struck upon brass bells, my best imitation of
the whirring of the fern owl, or finally, the angry
hum of a large humble-bee imprisoned in a paper
box, and held within three inches of the door of the
nest, appeared to produce any kind of effect. This
surprised me, I confess, for, though I am aware that
no auditory apparatus has as yet been discovered in
spiders, I can scarcely believe that they stand at so
great a disadvantage as creatures would seem to do
which lack the power of hearing.</p>

<p>These experiments must not, however, be taken
for more than they are worth; and the results
obtained may have been due rather to apathy in the
individual spider than to a want of perception in
the race generally. In any case they suggest the
need of further experiment and observation in this
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[ 207 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In October I carried this Californian spider out
with me to Mentone, and she lived there and appeared
plump and well until the end of the following month,
when she suddenly died, having laid one more group
of eggs in the interval. On examination, I found a
dark brown spot on one side of the abdomen, and
this, I think, probably indicates that her death was
caused by some insect of the ichneumon family,
which had laid its eggs within the spider's body,
after having stabbed it at the place indicated by the
discolouration.</p>

<p>Not very long before this melancholy event occurred,
I had put the spider to some inconvenience
in order to secure her portrait from life, to effect
which I took her from her nest and placed her in a
deep china saucer.</p>

<p>She exhibited the strongest dislike to exposure,
and sought to hide herself even under a fold of
blotting-paper which lay in the saucer with her. I
also noted that she appeared quite incapable of walking
up the sides of the saucer, and it would therefore
seem that she was destitute of the viscid hairs which
enable some spiders to traverse glazed and polished
surfaces.</p>

<p>Seeing this anxiety on the part of the spider for
concealment, it came into my mind that, perhaps, if
she were placed on the surface of a pot full of garden
mould she might excavate a tunnel in order to hide
herself from view. This I accordingly did in the
evening of November 15, and on the following morning
I was delighted to find that she had commenced
to dig and was still at work.</p>

<p>In little more than an hour's time the hollow had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[ 208 ]</a></span>
become about the size of half a walnut, and resembled
in its nearly semi-circular outline and size the surface
of the door of her own nest. I was greatly pleased
to be able to watch the creature at the work of excavation,
a sight which I believe no naturalist has ever
had before.</p>

<p>The legs took no part in the digging, and the palpi
were but little used, the mandibles and their fangs
being the implements chiefly employed. As soon as
a little earth had been loosened and gathered up, the
spider walked up to the edge of her excavation and
deposited there her mouthful of particles of earth,
separating and working the mandibles up and down
in the effort to part with the pellet, which had been
carried between the fangs and the mouth-organs.
Each pellet was very small, and the operation appeared
to be excessively tedious and laborious. I
had expected to see the spider scrape out large quantities
of earth at a time, and either drag it backwards
or kick it out behind her as a terrier does when
working at a rabbit-burrow; but no, every little
pellet removed was carried forwards, and deposited
separately on the "tip."</p>

<p>On the two following days, the 17th and 18th
November, the spider remained almost inactive, and
brooded over the cavity she had made, and which
still remained too shallow to conceal or even contain
her. At 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on the latter day I made a hole for
her in the earth, and, after some indecision, she took
possession of it. Next day, however, finding that she
remained motionless in the hole which I had made,
and displayed no apparent intention of either lining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[ 209 ]</a></span>
it with silk or furnishing it with a door, I replaced
her in her own nest.</p>

<p>Within a few days after this date I found her dead
at the bottom of her tube, and at first I was inclined
to fear that the treatment to which she had lately
been subjected might have caused her end. When,
however, I detected the brown spot on the side of the
abdomen, described above, and which so strongly recalled
the marks frequently observable in caterpillars
attacked by ichneumons, I came to the conclusion
that she had really died from the internal injuries
caused by the gnawing of these cruel parasites; and
that the eggs, laid long before by one of these insects,
had been hatched within her body and developed
into larv√¶, which, living upon her tissues, had at
length destroyed some vital part. It is surprising
that a creature, carrying within itself such a fatal
brood, should not only live, but be capable of undergoing
such adventures and misadventures as this
travelled spider endured with seeming indifference;
but similar facts are familiar to all those who have
attended to the rearing of caterpillars, and the
frequent disappointment caused by the death of apparently
sound specimens which have been attacked
in this way is but too well known.</p>

<p>It would appear that <i>Cteniza Californica</i> is peculiarly
amenable to captivity, and indeed to captivity
of the strictest kind.</p>

<p>My specimen lived during all the time she was in
my possession in a cocoatina tin, a cylindrical box
4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in. deep and 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, which always
stood among the books and papers on my writing-table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[ 210 ]</a></span>
It is probable that those trap-door spiders
which inhabit nests with short tubes, and which
therefore can be transported nest and all, would be
less disconcerted by imprisonment than is the case
with other kinds living at the bottom of a long
burrow which it is almost impossible to carry away
entire. This is borne out by what has been related
(<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 122) of the habits of <i>Cteniza
ionica</i> in captivity, which not only endured to have
its nest set upside down in a flower-pot, but actually
furnished the inverted base of the tube with a door
appropriate to its new position.</p>

<p>Canon Tristram (the well-known author and naturalist)
was so kind as to send me two trap-door
nests from Palestine for inspection; these were small
cork nests, the doors of which resembled those of the
Mentonese <i>Cteniza</i> (<i>Ct. Moggridgii</i>), but the tubes
were exceedingly short, and that of the more perfect
specimen, as I gather from Canon Tristram, measured
only two inches and an eighth in length when
entire.</p>

<p>The nests of <i>Cteniza ionica</i> are but little longer,
and that of the Mentonese <i>Cteniza</i>, though never so
shallow as these, are far less deep than those of
<i>Nemesia c√¶mentaria</i>, the builder of the typical cork
nest.</p>

<p>And now we will leave the nests of the cork type
and their inhabitants, and turn to the more intricate
group of nests belonging to the wafer type. Following
the order indicated in the diagrams, we will begin
with the simplest type of all, fig. C, and afterwards
take the remaining types one after the other, advancing
until we reach the most complex type, G.
The nest represented diagrammatically at fig. C, in
<a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>, is shown of the natural size in <a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI.</a>,
with the spider (<i>Nemesia Simoni</i>, Camb.) which constructs
it (fig. A 1).</p>

<div id="Plate_XVI" class="fig_center" style="width: 354px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XVI.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate16lg.png"><img src="images/plate16.png" width="354" height="641" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[ 211 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It belongs to the single-door unbranched wafer
type, of which one example has already been described
in the West Indian nest (see <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 79,
fig. B in woodcut); for, though this latter has a shorter
tube and a much stouter silk lining than is the case
with its European representative, there does not
appear to be sufficient difference to justify their separation
as distinct types.</p>

<p>This, which is the simplest known form of trap-door
nest, is quite new to Europe, and the spider
inhabiting it proves also to be one hitherto undescribed;
it has received from Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
the name of <i>Nemesia Simoni</i>,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> being so called in
honour of M. E. Simon, the well-known arachnologist.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_138" id="Footnote_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> Mr. Pickard-Cambridge describes <i>N. Simoni</i> at p. 297 below. This
species is remarkably well characterized, an assertion rarely to be made in the
case of those <i>Nemesias</i> of which, as in the present instance, the female only is
known. The elevated, rounded, and glabrous caput at once distinguishes it,
not to speak of other peculiarities. Mr. Pickard-Cambridge alludes to the
presence, in the specimens forwarded to him in spirits, of two singular indentations
on either side of the caput (fig. A 3, <a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a>). I did not observe this
when these spiders were alive, but I remember that the caput of one of these
spiders which had been injured in capture contracted and expanded spasmodically,
presenting a painful resemblance to laboured breathing. I have not
observed this in other spiders.</p></div>

<p>During last May (1874) we spent a few days at
Bordeaux on our homeward route. While there my
sister was fortunate enough to discover a single nest
of this type when we were out together on a spider-hunt
near the little village of Lormont, which is
situated on the opposite bank of the river to that on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[ 212 ]</a></span>
which the city stands. We subsequently found these
nests in tolerable abundance in a deep shady lane near
a restaurant called Mon R√©pos, on the same side of
the river, but rather farther up.</p>

<p>Here the hedge banks were high, and the soil was
composed of a fine even-grained loam of great depth,
which permitted the spiders to carry their tubes very
far down, some of them attaining a length of 15
inches.</p>

<p>This made it very difficult to follow them throughout
their whole course and so to assure oneself of the
real structure of the nests, but I succeeded in doing
this in twelve instances.</p>

<p>In every one of these I found the tube cylindrical
and unbranched throughout, and destitute of any
trace of a lower door.</p>

<p>This deficiency alone distinguishes the present type
from that to which the nest of <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i>
belongs; the latter being of the <i>double-door</i> and the
former of the <i>single-door, unbranched wafer type</i>.</p>

<p>But perhaps it may be asked whether it is safe to
assume that because twelve examples of this nest
were found to correspond in structure, and were
tenanted by the same occupant, that therefore all the
Bordeaux nests in which this particular spider might
be found would present similar peculiarities.</p>

<p>I greatly hope that other naturalists will put this
question to the test of actual investigation on the
spot, but I do not hesitate to assert my conviction
that this will prove to be the case.</p>

<p>The result of my experience among the nests of
the other <i>Nemesias</i>, scores of which I have carefully
examined in many widely separated localities, shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[ 213 ]</a></span>
that a given spider is invariably associated with a
fixed type of nest.</p>

<p>Thus, Cannes is from fifty to sixty miles distant
from San Remo, but the nests of <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, <i>N.
Manderstjern√¶</i>, and <i>N. Eleanora</i> show precisely the
same characteristics in either place.</p>

<p>Moreover, the twelve nests referred to were not all
taken from one restricted locality at Bordeaux, but
were found presenting the same characteristics and
occupied by the same spider in three distinct habitats,
distant some miles from one another. In two nests
several young spiders were found with the mother,
and, in one case where the family consisted of twenty-three
young ones, I observed that they were not all
equally small, and some had nearly attained one-third
of their full size.</p>

<p>This agreed with the fact that no very small nests
were observed, and it seems probable that the young
are not turned out of their nursery quite so early as
some of their relations are at Mentone. This, however,
varies perhaps in accordance with changes of
climate and local conditions.</p>

<p>We failed to detect any other type of nest at
Bordeaux than the one described above: and even
the cork nests, which we had shortly before seen in
such abundance at Montpellier, were apparently
absent.</p>

<p>Bordeaux is by far the north-westernmost point in
Europe<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> at which any spider constructing a true
trap-door nest has as yet been discovered; and the
fact that they exist in a climate so different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[ 214 ]</a></span>
that of the Riviera and of the whole Mediterranean
region, leads me to hope that their range may in
reality be much more widely extended than has
hitherto been supposed to be the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_139" id="Footnote_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_139"><span class="label">[139]</span></a> Cork nests have however been mentioned as occurring in the neighbourhood
of Lyons, which lies in nearly the same parallel of latitude with Bordeaux.</p></div>

<p>A glance at the vegetation of this district will
suffice to show how little there is that betokens either
a warm or dry winter climate; for here the myrtles,
oranges and olives are left far behind, and in their
place we see tall hedgerow elms, and poplars bearing
mistletoe on their branches.</p>

<p>Here therefore we are met by the question, How do
these Bordeaux spiders contrive to live under conditions
so different from those to which their relations
on the Riviera have adapted themselves? How do
they bear the cold and damp of the long winter, and
how is it that one frail upper door suffices to protect
their nest from molestation?</p>

<p>The thick coating of dead leaves, which covered
the banks even when we found them, no doubt aids
largely in their concealment, and the colder climate
probably diminishes the number of their enemies, but
their means of subsistence are most likely also less abundant
and their period of active life shorter.</p>

<p>The next type we have to consider is a totally new
one, and may be distinguished as the <i>single-door
branched wafer nest</i>. I detected this nest at Montpellier
but a few days before the visit to Bordeaux alluded to
above.</p>

<p>Circumstances unfortunately prevented me from
following up my discovery as closely as I could have
wished, and it appears moreover that this nest is far
less common at Montpellier than the typical cork
nest (<i>Nemesia c√¶mentaria</i>).</p>

<div id="Plate_XVII" class="fig_center" style="width: 336px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XVII.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate17lg.png"><img src="images/plate17.png" width="336" height="609" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[ 215 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope therefore that other naturalists will make
further investigations, and especially that they will
endeavour to secure the male.</p>

<p>I obtained twelve spiders and thoroughly followed
the course of ten nests; I opened thirteen more
nests, but failed to trace their structure satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The upper part of this nest is shown of the natural
size in <a href="#Plate_XVII">Plate XVII</a> with the spider (<i>Nemesia suffusa</i>,
Camb.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>) which constructs it. This is again a wafer
nest without any lower door, and this absence of a
lower door alone distinguishes it as a type from the
branched nest represented at F in the diagram, just
as the same deficiency separated the Bordeaux type
from that at fig. E.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_140" id="Footnote_140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_140"><span class="label">[140]</span></a> We have again in this instance an exemplification of the rule that a new
type of nest indicates the presence of a new spider, and hitherto, this rule has
proved without exception. Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's description of <i>N. suffusa</i>
will be found at p. 295, below. Its slender proportions, cylindrico-ovate abdomen,
marked with narrow linear chevrons, and caput without, or almost without,
any median line or marking, form some of its more striking characteristics.</p></div>

<p>In this new single-door branched type, the branch
makes a more or less acute angle with the main tube,
and reaches the surface of the ground, but is there
closed by a layer of particles of earth slightly bound
together with silk, forming an immovable cover or
thatch. This cover constitutes, however, but a slight
obstruction and could easily be torn away by the
spider if she needed to use this passage as a way of
escape.</p>

<p>These nests were tolerably plentiful at a place
called Les Mourines, a short distance from Montpellier,
where they were mixed with cork nests in the
steep hedge banks. The nests were from 8 to 10
inches deep, and, as in all the trap-door nests which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[ 216 ]</a></span>
have examined, were tenanted by the female alone.
It seems strange that this spider, building as she
does a nest apparently but poorly furnished either for
concealment or defence, should be able to enter into
competition with <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, whose solid, closely-fitting
door appears so perfectly contrived for both.
It will probably be found, however, when we are better
acquainted with their respective ways of life, that
they are really more nearly on a footing than they
seem to be at first sight. I detected the remains of
ants and the elytra of a beetle in one of these branched
single-door nests. Now these may also be found in
cork nests, so that <i>Nemesia suffusa</i> evidently competes
with <i>c√¶mentaria</i> for its food, and this is of course the
main cause of contention between all living creatures.</p>

<p>It is possible, that, if we knew all the uses to
which the branch is put by the spider which constructs
it, we should find that the advantages derived
in the way of security from the existence of this
second passage, counterbalance those possessed by
the cork nest, which, though so perfectly closed, has
only the one tube, and no other possible way of
escape.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be no more than a coincidence, but
we can scarcely avoid commenting upon the fact,
that, just as this Montpellier wafer nest is simpler in
construction than any found along the Riviera, so in
like manner is the Bordeaux nest simpler than that
of Montpellier. It thus becomes tempting to ask
whether, in the case of these wafer nests, we shall
not discover that the colder and damper climates are
the homes of the builders of the simpler types, while
the warmer and drier ones, where more food, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[ 217 ]</a></span>
enemies and more competitors are found, are reserved
for the architects of the more complicated nests.</p>

<p>Doubtless naturalists will soon discover wafer nests
on the slopes of the Pyrenees, as for example at Pau
and other winter stations in South-western France;
and perhaps the coast of the Bay of Biscay may also
yield specimens, even to the north of Bordeaux. If
so, this curious speculation as to whether there is any
relation between simplicity of structure and warmth
of climate, will be put on its trial.</p>

<p>About the very time when I was engaged in digging
out these new wafer nests at Montpellier, the celebrated
arachnologist, Dr. L. Koch of Nuremberg, had just
published<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> an account and figure of a very remarkable
nest which he had received from Australia, and which,
though differing both in form and proportions from
the Montpellier nest, may nevertheless perhaps be
referred to the present single-door branched wafer type.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_141" id="Footnote_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_141"><span class="label">[141]</span></a> Dr. L. Koch, <i>Arachniden Australiens</i>, 10te. Lieferuug, Nurnberg, 1874,
tab. xxxvii. fig. 3, p. 484.</p></div>

<p>This Australian nest, the exact habitat of which
is not mentioned, is constructed by a spider now described
for the first time under the name of <i>Idioctis
helva</i>. The nest has a wafer-door about the size of a
sixpence, closing a vertical tube less than half an
inch long, which meets and opens into a horizontal
tube about three inches in length, and forms with it
what may be roughly likened to the figure of a capital
T inverted, thus, &#9529;.</p>

<p>The upstroke of the T is however, very short, and
one of the arms is longer than the other, and curved
downwards at its extremity. This is, as far as I know,
the first recorded example of a wafer-nest from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[ 218 ]</a></span>
Antipodes, and it may be regarded as one of the first
fruits of a harvest which lies ready for the reaping
of any naturalist resident in those parts. Hitherto the
only nests which I have seen or heard of from Australia
were of the cork type (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 132).</p>

<p>Next in order to the single-door branched wafer
comes the <i>double-door unbranched wafer</i> type, which
is the simplest of all the nests possessing two doors.
This habitation, the work of <i>N. Eleanora</i>, has been
already described (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 106), and I have
not much to add to the account there given.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers may remember that,
while I was actually engaged on the proofs of <i>Ants
and Spiders</i> I had one of these <i>Eleanora</i> spiders in
captivity, and that I gave an account (p. 148) of her
behaviour up to the latest moment possible. She
had been captured on October 23, 1872, and
placed, together with five young ones found with her
in the nest, on the surface of some earth in a medium-sized
flower-pot covered over with gauze. The young
ones soon made nests for themselves in the earth, each
furnished with its little door, but the mother roamed
about on the surface of the soil, and it was not
until she had been twenty-one days in captivity
that she commenced spinning a silk cell.</p>

<p>This cell in twelve days' time presented the form
of a rude figure of 8, and had an aperture at either
end; it was just large enough to contain the spider
when the legs were extended; its upper surface
was attached to the gauze covering of the pot, and its
lower to the earth. It was at this stage that the
record was broken off, and I will now relate the
remainder of the history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[ 219 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Four days before the cell was commenced, the
spider had covered the under surface of the gauze
with a semi-transparent film of a substance resembling
varnish, which formed a band about three inches
long by half an inch wide, close to where the rim
of the flower-pot threw the most shade. It was at
one extremity of this band that the silk-cell was
formed, but it is important to note that this band of
varnish was longer than the cell, which only measured
an inch and a quarter from end to end, for we shall see
that the layer of varnish was apparently laid with a
view to further operations.</p>

<p>In four days after the completion of the cell its
form was modified, and, during the next ten days
(up to December 21st), the spider gradually thickened
the walls, and made the form of the cell more and
more cylindrical, sometimes closing and at other times
opening the extremities.</p>

<p>Between December 14th and 25th, she lengthened
out the cell by spinning a cylindrical silk tube in prolongation
of one end, and this tube followed the
course of the band of varnish, the whole measuring
three-and-a-half inches in length by about half an inch
in diameter.</p>

<p>It would appear therefore from the correspondence
in length between the band of varnish and this silk
tube, that she had contemplated the construction of
the latter when she first commenced her work on
November 3rd.</p>

<p>On January 19th the silk tube parted from
the gauze, leaving only the enlarged end which
formed the cell still adhering to it. On the
following day I observed the very curious fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[ 220 ]</a></span>
that when I sprinkled the nest with water, as it was
my custom to do every morning, the tube, which had
become somewhat flaccid since it had lost its attachment
to the gauze, gradually recovered its perfect
shape. This was repeated for eleven days, until on the
morning of the twelfth day (January 31st), finding
the tube completely collapsed, instead of merely
sprinkling water over it, I drew a large camel-hair
brush loaded with water along its whole length, when
the tube started up, and almost instantaneously regained
its cylindrical form.</p>

<p>This morning the spider had left her cell, and was
roaming about the pot when I wetted the tube, thus
proving that she was in no way concerned with its
movements, which were no doubt due to hygrometric
action.</p>

<p>Between this time and February 25th, I constantly
restored the tube to its shape by wetting it in the
way above described, but on this day it remained very
flaccid, and only expanded partially. For some days
previous to this date, the spider had left the tube when
it collapsed, and only returned to it again when it had
resumed its shape. On the following day I found
the entire silk tube and the cell again collapsed and
lying flat upon the ground, and this time water failed
to produce its previous effect.</p>

<p>The spider then became very restless and excited,
and I observed that the door of one of the little nests
constructed by one of her five offspring which had
been imprisoned in the same pot with her, had been torn
off, and thrown on one side, and there could be little
doubt but that the mother had been guilty of this
very un-maternal action. By the evening she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[ 221 ]</a></span>
pulled up her collapsed tube from its attachment to
the earth, and had coiled it in a confused heap. Seeing
this, and fearing that, in her distress and excitement,
she might do further damage to the young spiders,
which had up to that time thriven well, I made a
cylindrical hole for her in the earth, supposing that
she would at once take possession of it. On the
following morning, however, the mother spider had
advanced some way in building another figure-of-8 cell,
rising the shrivelled silk of her previous dwelling as a
foundation.</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours this second cell was complete,
and closely resembled the former one, save that the
smaller end of the 8 was turned in the opposite
direction, but, on examining it, I found to my surprise
that it was empty! The spider had taken possession
of the hole I had made for her, which she had at
first refused to notice, and was busily employed in
lining it with silk and furnishing it with a covering
composed of silk with earth and fragments of moss
woven into the surface. By mid-day the aperture
was completely closed, but there was no moveable
door. From this time (February 28) up to April 12,
the spider lived in this hole, which she eventually
furnished with a distinct wafer-door, and, as I found
on opening the nest, with a typical lower door also.
This latter was not neatly made, but still it possessed
all features the essential which characterize these
lower doors in the nests of <i>N. Eleanora</i>.</p>

<p>So this captive <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> lived in a flower-pot
in my bedroom for more than five months and a
half, during which time she absolutely refused to
burrow or to attempt any kind of excavation, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[ 222 ]</a></span>
passed the greater part of that period on the surface
of the earth in a silk tube ending in an oblong enlargement,
utterly unlike her normal habitation.
Finally, when I had done the digging for her, she
furnished the cylindrical hole I had bored in the
earth with a silk lining, and made it secure with her
own two typical doors.</p>

<p>The figure-of-8 cell which she constructed at first,
and subsequently modified until it became the oblong
enlargement of the tube alluded to above, was totally
unlike any form of trap-door spider's nest known to
me; but in its ultimate shape (which resembled that
of the glass part of a thermometer with an oblong
bulb, save that it was curved and not straight), I
think we may trace some resemblance to the silk tube
which is made by <i>Atypus</i>, and of which a figure is
given at A, <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, p. 183; the mouth of the tube
made by my captive was, however, open. It is curious,
also, when we recall this resemblance, to note that
Mr. Brown has recorded, in his observations alluded
to above (p. 185), that the tube of one of the nests of
<i>Atypus</i>, which he brought home in a collapsed state,
showed a somewhat similar tendency to become distended.
For, on opening the box in which they had
been carried, he perceived a movement throughout
the tube as if it were becoming inflated, and though
this inflation appeared to subside shortly after, yet the
following morning the tube had recovered its cylindrical
shape. I am tempted to believe, though this
is mere conjecture, that the box in which these tubes
were put contained moisture, and that their apparent
inflation was due to the same hygrometric action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[ 223 ]</a></span>
which, was displayed in the tube of <i>N. Eleanora</i>.
I regretted that I was unable to continue my observations
on this captive spider, as it would have been
interesting to know how long she would have lived
contentedly and in good health under the conditions
described above, but I left Mentone at the end of
April, and was unable to take her alive with me to
England. When removed from her nest in the pot
on April 12, she appeared in perfect condition, and I
placed her in a hole which I made for her among
some stones in a garden at the back of the house,
hoping to find her again on my return to Mentone in
the autumn; this hope was, however, not destined to
be realized.</p>

<p>I shall, however, have occasion to speak again of
the young captives of this species (<i>N. Eleanora</i>), in
the concluding remarks which will follow these
detailed accounts of the nests and their occupants,
when the behaviour of captive trap-door spiders generally
will be treated of.</p>

<p>The next type of trap-door nest is one to which I
have found it difficult to assign a descriptive name,
and I am compelled for the present to speak of it as
the <i>Hy√®res double-door branched wafer</i> nest.</p>

<p>One of its most distinctive features is found in the
shape of the lower door, fig. F 1, <a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>, and figs.
A 1, A 2, <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII.</a>, which may be said to be double,
presenting two crowns, one of which fits into the main
tube and the other into the branch, but I could not
see my way to employing this character in naming
the type. The nest is, however, quite distinct from
all the others, and is inhabited by a new species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[ 224 ]</a></span>
trap-door spider (<i>N. congener</i>, Camb.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>). The characteristic
portions of this nest are shown in <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>,
and fig. A 3, in the same Plate, represents its occupant.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_142" id="Footnote_142"></a><a href="#FNanchor_142"><span class="label">[142]</span></a> Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's description will be found at p. 292, below. In its
characters this female spider (the male is unknown) most nearly resembles <i>N.
c√¶mentaria</i>, but differs, among other points, in markings and in having one or
more spines on the genual joint of leg, these spines being almost always absent
in the same joint in <i>c√¶mentaria</i>. The nests of the two species are totally
unlike.</p></div>

<p>The hedge-banks near Hy√®res, and also about the
railway station of the same name, which is some
4 miles from the town itself, are frequently tenanted
by this spider. During a short stay there in May,
1873, I secured a large number of specimens, and
verified the structure of the nest by a careful examination
of thirty-eight examples. The nest is invariably
branched and furnished with a lower door,
but the branch is of variable length, usually short,
and never, as far as I could detect, quite reaches the
surface. In some cases this branch was so short that
it could scarcely contain the spider, and, under these
circumstances, it is not easy to conceive any other use
for it than that of retaining the lower door when not
in use. It may, however, enable the spider to take
up a rather better position when engaged, as she
frequently is if disturbed, in keeping the main tube
closed by pressing the lower door upwards with her
feet, for then her head points downwards, and her
abdomen rests in the branch.</p>

<div id="Plate_XVIII" class="fig_center" style="width: 350px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XVIII.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate18lg.png"><img src="images/plate18.png" width="350" height="609" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[ 225 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen her in this attitude on several occasions
when I had cut out a block of earth similar to that
figured in the plate. The lower door is quite unlike
that of either of the other two double-door wafer
nests, being wedge-shaped, tapering from below upwards
to the hinge, which is always placed at the
point of bifurcation of the tubes, and having two
crowns separated from each other by the gusset-like
web of silk which connects the door on either side
with the lining of the main tube, one of these crowns
fitting into and closing the main tube, while the other
fits into the aperture of the branch.</p>

<p>The wedge-shaped structure of the door is seen in
its most exaggerated form in the nests of the younger
spiders (figs. B, B 1, <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>), and becomes less
so in the older and larger ones (figs. A 1, A 2). I
have even seen some of these lower doors, evidently
made by old spiders, which were so much flattened as to
bear a considerable resemblance to that of <i>N. Eleanora</i>.</p>

<p>The main tube of the nest is from 10 to 12 inches
long, and usually enters the earth almost horizontally,
bending downwards from the point at which the
branch joins it, and where the lower door is hung.
This causes the lower door to lie nearly horizontally
when not in use, and its lower crown probably serves,
by fitting into the aperture of the branch, to sustain
it in this position and prevent it from falling forward.
The point of bifurcation is placed, as a rule, much
nearer to the entrance of the nest, than it is in the
two other branched nests, and occurs usually within
two inches of the surface of the earth; so close is it
indeed that, on lifting the upper door and looking in,
one may frequently see the lower door move across
and close the passage down the main tube, pushed by
the spider from below. This frequently enabled me
to secure the spider without having to follow her to
the bottom of the nest; and, when fortune favoured
me, I secured a block of earth by one rapid sweep of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[ 226 ]</a></span>
the knife (a common table-knife), which furnished me
at once with a good specimen of the nest and of its
occupant.</p>

<p>When the spider has once fairly determined upon
resistance, it is scarcely possible to make her retreat
without destroying the nest, and, in one case, when I
tried to push the lower door down from above, while
she was pressing it upwards from below, I found
that, without crushing my opponent, I could not
succeed.</p>

<p>There were probably young in the nest on this
occasion, for I have frequently found them in the
nests with the mother at this season. In no case did
I even catch a glimpse of the male, and this sex is at
present unknown.</p>

<p>The young spiders make their nests at an early
age, and there can be no doubt that <i>N. congener</i>
enlarges its dwelling from time to time as growth
demands, just as the trap-door spiders at Mentone do.
Indeed in one of these new Hy√®res nests I found,
outside the main tube and some way above the
existing lower door, a former and disused lower door
much smaller than the one then in use, and which
had evidently belonged to the nest at a previous
stage of its development. I have observed this
before in the nests both of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> and <i>N.
Eleanora</i>.</p>

<p>This new type is strictly intermediate between the
double-door unbranched wafer nest constructed by
<i>N. Eleanora</i>, and the double-door branched wafer with
the descending cavity which I am now about to
describe.</p>

<p>This latter nest, the work of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[ 227 ]</a></span>
Auss.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> (formerly called <i>N. meridionalis</i>), has already
been partially made known by the figures and description
given of it in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> (Plates IX., X.,
and XI., pp. 98, 100, and 104); but I have to confess,
with great regret, that when these illustrations and descriptions
were published, I was not fully acquainted
with the true structure of this nest, having overlooked
the existence of a short descending cavity which leaves
the main tube a little above and on the opposite side
to the ascending branch. This cavity is always
present, but the very largest and oldest spiders
usually allow it to become filled up with remains
of food and particles of earth, and sometimes even
spin silk across its entrance, in which case it can only
be traced on very close examination.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_143" id="Footnote_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> This spider was described by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge at p. 101 in <i>Ants
and Spiders</i>, under the name of <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa. This name has now to
be abandoned for reasons given in full by Mr. Cambridge at p. 283, below. It
would appear that a spider discovered by M. Simon in Corsica corresponds more
closely with the <i>N. meridionalis</i> of Costa than our spider of the Riviera does.
Moreover, since <i>Ants and Spiders</i> was written I have had the good fortune to
obtain at Mentone four male examples of our supposed <i>meridionalis</i>, and these
prove to possess the same characters as those assigned by Prof. Ausserer to a
male spider which was captured at Nice, and named by him <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>.
This specimen is now in the possession of Dr. L. Koch, to whom I am much
indebted for having kindly entrusted it to me for examination. This enabled
Mr. Pickard-Cambridge to assure himself of the specific identity of his
<i>N. meridionalis</i> with <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, which latter name it must for the
future bear.</p></div>

<p>It was from an old nest such as this, in which the
descending cavity had been closed up, that the large
drawing at fig. A on Plate IX of <i>Ants and
Spiders</i> was made, and this figure, therefore, still
remains substantially correct.</p>

<p>But in the case of the other illustrations&mdash;namely,
fig. B, Plate IX, fig. A, Plate X, and figs. B and B 1,
Plate XI, where nests of young spiders, or of spiders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[ 228 ]</a></span>
which, though adult, have not attained the maximum
size, are represented, this descending cavity, though
overlooked by me, should have been shown, for it
must certainly have existed.</p>

<p>Its presence was first observed by the Honourable
L. G. Dillon, who detected it when tracing the course
of the main tube upwards from below. I had always
followed the tube from above downwards, and in so
doing must have unwittingly filled up the descending
cavity (the existence of which I was far from suspecting)
with detached particles of earth.</p>

<p>I will own that, when Mr. Dillon first showed me
this new feature, I hoped that it might prove to be
something accidental and exceptional; and it was
only after careful examination of a large series of
nests of all sizes, that I gradually and almost unwillingly
admitted that this descending cavity formed
an important feature in the typical structure of the
nests.</p>

<p>I now see, however, that the presence of this cavity
adds considerably to the interest of the structure as a
whole, and places its architect quite at the head of
all the builders of trap-door nests. This type should
now be called, for the sake of distinction, the <i>double-door,
branched, cavity, wafer</i> nest, to avoid confusion
with the <i>Hy√®res branched nest</i>.</p>

<p>I am now about to endeavour to atone for my past
oversight by giving new illustrations (<a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>,
figs. A and B) and descriptions of this very remarkable
nest; while I would at the same time beg the indulgence
of my readers for past and present shortcomings,
reminding them that the interest which attaches to
structures of this kind is proportioned to the complexity
and subtlety of their contrivance, and, therefore,
to the difficulty we experience in properly understanding
and describing them.</p>

<div id="Plate_XIX" class="fig_center" style="width: 336px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XIX.</i></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[ 229 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen by a reference to <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> figs.
A and A 1, that in addition to the cylindrical branch,
which mounts upwards, there is a shorter branch
which leaves the main tube on the opposite side (on
the left as seen in the Plate), and takes a downward
course. Now this descending branch, which is barely
more than an inch in length, is a cavity of variable
form, being sometimes cylindrical, and sometimes egg- or
even watch-shaped,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> but there is one particular in
which it never varies, and that is the position of its
elliptic orifice. This orifice is always situated on the
opposite side of the main tube to that on which the
ascending branch leaves this latter, so that the whole
nest, when seen in section, presents the figure
of a St. Andrew's cross, only with arms of unequal
length.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144" id="Footnote_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> A nest of a scarcely half-grown spider is here represented in order that
sufficient space might be gained to show the lower door in its two positions.
The perfect cavity is still found in nests of much larger dimensions, and occasionally,
indeed, in nests of almost the maximum size.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_145" id="Footnote_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> I take the liberty of coining a word to replace "lenticular," the form of a
watch being more familiar than that of a lens.</p></div>

<p>But the most remarkable point is that, when the
lower door is pushed across so as to close the main
tube (as shown in fig. A, <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>), it will invariably
be found to lie in such a position that its
lower extremity exactly meets the lower lip of the
orifice of the descending cavity, when it will be seen
that the semi-cylindrical surface of the lower door
then coincides with, and appears to continue and
form part of, the lower wall of the descending cavity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[ 230 ]</a></span>
on the one side, and of the corresponding wall of the
main tube on the other. When the upper portion of
the main tube is thus united to the cavity the two
combine to form what appears like a short, independent
unbranched nest.</p>

<p>Now, if we fancy ourselves an insect entering the
nest in search either of the spider, her eggs, or young,
I think it is plain that, when the lower door is in
this position (fig. A), we should probably walk straight
down to the bottom of the cavity, expecting to find
our prey there, and should then return by the way we
came, impressed with the belief that we had explored
the whole nest, the secret of the lower door remaining
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Whether this imaginary case may, or may not,
represent what really takes place, is of course mere
conjecture; but the constant occurrence of this beautiful
adaptation of the various parts to one another,
surely points to the conclusion that this is no mere
coincidence, but rather a subtle contrivance having
some very definite use and meaning.</p>

<p>We must admit, however, that it is difficult to
conceive why, if this structure is of such great utility,
it should be abandoned by the oldest and largest
spiders.</p>

<p>Among the possible answers to this question I
think that one of the more probable is that this
arrangement may have been specially devised for
protection against some enemy which the aged spiders
have ceased to fear.</p>

<p>Indeed it is not unlikely that these aged spiders
may have come to a time of life when they no longer
lay eggs, and so do not need to keep up all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[ 231 ]</a></span>
defences which they employed when they had families
to protect.</p>

<p>Since my attention was drawn to the existence of
this cavity in the dwellings of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> I have
never noted the presence of young in those nests in
which the cavity was filled up and disused; but then
I have only exact records with reference to this point
in the case of seven nests.</p>

<p>In these seven nests, however, there was no free
cavity, and there were no young spiders, though it
was at the season when it was common to find young
in the nests.</p>

<p>The question, therefore, remains open, and further
observations on this head would be very acceptable.
I detected the <i>d√©bris</i> of insects, and especially the
horny coats of ants, in the descending cavity, in many
nests; and in some of the oldest, where it had become
completely blocked up, these remains still indicated
its former outlines and position.</p>

<p>The nests of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> at Cannes correspond
both in respect of the cavity and of their other characteristics
with those at Mentone. <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>
occurs pretty abundantly at San Remo in the olive-grounds
east of the Sanctuary, but I can say nothing
as to whether the nests there possessed the cavity or
not, for, when I was there, I was not aware of its
existence. I obtained a single example of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>
and its nest at Hy√®res, and this is the
westernmost point at which this species has as yet
been detected.</p>

<p>We have now passed in review all the seven known
types of true trap-door nest, and have taken note also
of the lower and more rudimentary forms of nest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[ 232 ]</a></span>
such as that of <i>Atypus</i>, and the funnel nest of <i>Cyrtauchenius
elongatus</i>, neither of which is furnished with
a door.</p>

<p>Among the true trap-door nests, those of the cork
type stand in a measure alone, being distinguished
from all the others by their solid surface doors, composed
of many layers of silk and earth; and we do
not at present know of any intermediate forms linking
the cork and wafer types together. But among the
various nests which represent the wafer type the case
is different, for here the types naturally fall into a
progressive series, such as that represented in the
diagrams (<a href="#Plate_XIV">Pl. XIV</a>, p. 193).</p>

<p>If we try to picture to ourselves the stages through
which the most complicated wafer nest&mdash;namely, that
of the <i>double-door, branched, cavity</i> type (Diagram G 1)
may have passed in the course of its development
from a simpler ancestral form, we should <i>√† priori</i>
expect to find precisely such structures as the <i>Hy√®res
double-door branched</i> nest (Diagram F), and the <i>single-door
branched</i> nest (Diagram D) forming successive
halting-places in the advance from the primitive
<i>single-door, unbranched</i> nest (Diagram C).</p>

<p>The <i>double-door unbranched</i> type may in like manner
find its prototype in the same original single-door unbranched
nest (C), which we may look upon as the
parent idea, from which all these structures have been
derived.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, and remembering that kinship
between living creatures is not only revealed to
us by likeness in structure and colour, but also by
similarity in habits and instincts, it becomes of interest
to trace any resemblance that may exist between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[ 233 ]</a></span>
these wafer-nests and the dwellings constructed by
<i>Lycosa narbonensis</i>, a species belonging to the allied
family of <i>Lycosid√¶</i>, and which closely resembles the
true <i>tarantula</i><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> of Southern Italy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_146" id="Footnote_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146"><span class="label">[146]</span></a> In the United States, and indeed in the New World generally, it seems to
be the custom to call all the larger "ground spiders," and especially the trap-door
spiders, Tarantulas, but these, in fact, form a distinct group by themselves,
belonging to the family <i>Lycosid√¶</i>.</p></div>

<p>I first made the acquaintance of <i>Lycosa narbonensis</i>
near the glass-works west of Cannes, where this
spider may not rarely be found living in tubular
burrows in sandy clearings among the pine woods
along the shore (<i>Pinus pinea</i>, the stone pine).</p>

<p>I have already (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 146), alluded
to an account given by M. L√©on Dufour of his observations
on the nest and habits of the true tarantula
(<i>Lycosa tarentula</i>), which he discovered in Spain.</p>

<p>The nests of <i>L. narbonensis</i> at Cannes resembled
those described by M. Dufour, but the cylindrical,
subterranean burrows were apparently shorter. It
was extremely difficult to trace their course, on account
of the loose sand which poured into the tubes
and choked them up, and I only succeeded in doing
so completely in one case, when I stuffed the tube
with cotton-wool before proceeding to dig. Here the
open tube, which was quite simple, and about 1 inch
in diameter, descended vertically for 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches, and
was then suddenly bent so as to become horizontal,
terminating shortly afterwards in a triangular chamber,
the floor of which measured 2 inches across at the
widest part, and was strewed with the remains of
beetles and other insects.</p>

<p>The nest was lined throughout with coarse silk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[ 234 ]</a></span>
which had a blackish hue, owing to the presence of
the filaments of what I believe to have been some undeveloped
fungoid growth. The mouth of the tube
was open, and frequently surmounted by a short
tubular prolongation, commencing at the surface of
the ground, which formed a sort of chimney about an
inch high and from an inch to an inch and a quarter
across; this was composed of fibres of plants, pine-needles,
and especially of a large branching lichen,
very common in the neighbourhood of the nests, and
all these materials were woven together and kept
in place by a few threads of silk spun here and
there.</p>

<p>It was not every nest that was furnished with a
chimney, nor were all the chimneys equally complete,
for in some cases they consisted merely of a small
rim or one-sided lip, while in others they resembled
little birds' nests, and were sufficiently firm and compact
to permit of my carrying them away. It appeared
to me that these chimneys served as screens to
prevent the loose sand from being swept into the
burrows by the winds which rage over that open seashore
plain, and that they were more or less complete
in proportion as the exposure was greater or less, and
the sand looser or more bound together.</p>

<p>I captured eight of these spiders, and here, as in
the trap-door group, the female alone inhabited the
nest.</p>

<p>Besides this habit, they have other points in common
with trap-door spiders; such, for example, as
the resemblance which exists between this nest and
that of <i>Theraphosa Blondii</i> from Brazil (see p. 188,
above), and between the chimney of this Tarantula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[ 235 ]</a></span>
and the a√´rial prolongation of the tube sometimes
found in nests of the wafer type.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most suggestive point of resemblance
consists in the habit which this Tarantula
possesses of covering and closing the aperture of the
nest during the winter with a thin layer of materials,
similar to those of which the chimney is composed,
and, like them, bound together with silk. This is, in
fact, an immovable wafer-door, and precisely resembles
those which I have seen constructed by
<i>Nemesia Manderstjern√¶</i>, and <i>N. Eleanora</i>, when captive
and placed in an artificial hole in the earth.</p>

<p>The tubes are, as has been already stated, open
during the spring, and we may suppose that the
spider, on the approach of warm weather, wakes up
from her winter lethargy, and tears away this concealing
thatch. But if one of these spiders should
by chance happen to free this silk-woven thatch by
cutting round some three-fourths of its circumference,
so as to leave it still attached to the rim of the
aperture of the nest by the remaining quarter, she
would then have made for herself a veritable, though
rather rude trap-door of the wafer kind.</p>

<p>It is most likely, however, that the spider knows
what she is about and that a door to her dwelling
would be the reverse of an advantage to her, for she
is more powerful and swifter than the generality of
European trap-door spiders, and, as she probably
lives by leaping out upon and hunting her prey, she
no doubt needs to have the entrance to her nest free
of all encumbrance.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Rev. W. G. Brackenridge
for evidence of the very interesting fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[ 236 ]</a></span>
<i>Lycosa narbonensis</i> closes her nest at Cannes in the
winter.</p>

<p>I was aware that Latreille stated that the Tarantula
possessed this habit,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> and I was anxious to know
whether the species which I had detected at Cannes,
inhabiting as it did open nests in the month of May,
would also exhibit this curious custom. Being unable
to visit Cannes myself during the winter, I applied to
Mr. Brackenridge, who, on the 28th of January last
(1874), secured a very perfect specimen of the a√´rial
portion or chimney of one of the nests having the
orifice closed in the way above described, and most
kindly transmitted it to me.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_147" id="Footnote_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> P. A. Latreille, Mem. Soc. Hist. Nat., Paris (an. VII. de la R√©publique),
p. 124: "L'araign√©e <i>tarentule</i> ferme aussi son habitation, mais cet opercule n'est
pas mobile, et n'est construit que pour l'hiver."</p></div>

<p>I have, on a very few occasions, found the doors of
a wafer or cork nest spun up during the winter at
Mentone, and on digging have discovered the spider
alive, though partially torpid, inside; but this is
quite an exceptional event. I should much like to
know, however, whether this becomes the rule in the
case of the nests of those trap-door spiders which
inhabit climates less favoured than that of Mentone.</p>

<p>In my concluding remarks in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> I
called attention to the importance which attaches to
a knowledge of the food and manner of feeding of
any creature whose life-history we may wish to study,
and I would now once more press the subject on
the attention of my readers. For the range and distribution
of a species largely depends upon the
nature of its food, and this will also be an indication
of the rivals with which it has to compete in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[ 237 ]</a></span>
the struggle for existence; the times and seasons
of its activity, and in many cases even the structure
and position of its dwelling-place will be
governed by this same all-important question of food-supply.</p>

<p>I have now detected the remains of insects, and of
ants especially, in the nest of every species of trap-door
spider which I have examined <i>in situ</i>; very frequently,
however, one may open several nests in
succession without finding any of these <i>d√©bris</i>, and at
other times they will only be detected beneath the
existing bottom of the tube, layers of silk having
been spun over successive layers of refuse.</p>

<p>The horny coats of ants form by very far the largest
proportion of these remains, and I have lately been
much struck by the number of instances in which,
while digging out ants' nests at Mentone, I have found
trap-door nests (especially those of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>
and <i>N. Moggridgii</i>) in their midst, the tubes often
traversing the very heart of the ants' colony and
coming into close contact with the galleries and
chambers of the ants. The doors in these instances
had almost always escaped my notice, and, indeed,
they so closely resembled the surface of the ground
that even when I knew, from having accidentally cut
across the tube below ground, that one of these doors
must lie near a given spot, yet I could only discover
it by following the passage from below upwards.
This perfect concealment is doubtless of essential
importance to the spiders' success in life, for, if they
once alarmed the whole colony of ants and let them
know the exact whereabouts of their lurking-place,
they would soon learn to avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[ 238 ]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as it is, the work of opening the door,
snatching in an ant, and closing it again, is but the
affair of a second or two, and before the companions
of the victim have time to realize the nature of the
phenomenon, the gaping earth has closed again and
become once more, to all appearance, part of the solid
and trustworthy ground.</p>

<p>I have seen <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> snatch at insects in this
way during the daytime, and I well remember how I
started on one occasion when, as I was looking fixedly
at a small blue gnat which I had taken for a moth, I
saw the earth suddenly open and one of these spiders
partly emerge, make a swift stroke at the insect, and
withdraw again as swiftly.</p>

<p>I have found the remains of ants, of beetles of
many species and different sizes, of wood-lice (<i>Oniscus</i>),
and of earwigs (<i>Forficula</i>) in the nests of <i>N. Eleanora</i>
and <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, and the wings of a large green
field-bug in the nest of the former. I have only once
detected traces of food in the dwellings of <i>Cteniza
Moggridgii</i>, and these consisted of minute fragments
of the integuments of insects, none of which were
certainly recognisable, though I believe that they
partly consisted of the coats of a small species of ant.
The rarity or complete absence of the wings of insects
which habitually fly rather than crawl on the ground,
and my inability to discover either snares or any
evidence that these spiders ever leave the nest, lead
me to believe that they live (at any rate from October
to May) by dragging into their nests any insects
which approach within reach.</p>

<p>Ants, earwigs, beetles, and wood-lice are precisely
the very creatures which would fall a prey to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[ 239 ]</a></span>
spider without obliging her to leave her nest, and it is
accordingly their remains that we find.</p>

<p>On one occasion, however, at Montpellier, my sister
detected <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> in the act of devouring a fair-sized
caterpillar, to obtain which there is some reason
to think she must have left her nest. We were out
together on the 8th of May last (1874), hunting for
the new wafer nests of that district, under the kind
guidance of M. Lichtenstein, when my sister called
our attention to a caterpillar, the body of which partly
projected from the tube of a cork nest (<i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>),
and prevented the lid from closing.</p>

<p>On closer examination we found that the spider
was in the act of devouring the caterpillar, and had
already sucked out the juices from the anterior portion,
while the middle and posterior parts of the body
still resisted, and the legs clung tenaciously to the lip
of the nest.</p>

<p>M. Lichtenstein told us that this larva, which when
entire must have been rather more than an inch long,
was that of the mullein moth (<i>Cucullia verbasci</i>).</p>

<p>It was not full grown, and as there were no mullein
plants within some two feet of the nest and this
caterpillar will not leave the plant on which it feeds
unless compelled, it would seem as if the spider must
have gone afield in order to capture it. It is possible,
nevertheless, that the caterpillar may have fallen
within reach of the spider when blown off the mullein
leaves by the wind.</p>

<p>I have, unfortunately, but few details to give of the
nocturnal habits of the trap-door spiders. It would
appear, however, that they are more active by night
than by day, and that it is more common to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[ 240 ]</a></span>
their doors ajar at night, with the spiders posted
on the look-out at the narrow opening. This is
borne out by my observations on captive spiders, to
which I shall allude shortly.</p>

<p>When at Hy√®res on the 11th of May, 1873, the
evening being very warm and a bright moon shining,
I went at 8:30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> with my father and sister to see
what the spiders would be doing on a hedge bank
where we had previously marked five cork and eight
wafer nests. The moonlight did not fall upon this
spot, but I was provided with a lantern, and by its
light the nests at first appeared to be tightly closed,
but we soon perceived first one and then another with
the door slightly raised, ready to close on the smallest
alarm, whether from a footfall or from the flickering
of the lamp. When the light of the lantern was
steady it did not appear to frighten the spiders in the
least, even when brought to within a few inches of
the door,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> and this enabled me to watch them very
closely. On either side of the raised door of one of
the wafer nests I could see the feet of the spider
projecting, and just at that moment I caught sight of
a beetle close at hand, feeding on the topmost spray
of some small plant below. Using every precaution,
I contrived to gather the spray without shaking off
the beetle, and gradually pushed it nearer and nearer
to the nest. When it almost touched the lip of the
nest the door flew open, and the spider snatched at
the beetle and dragged it down below.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_148" id="Footnote_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> This had been observed before both by my father and Mr. Dillon when
watching the trap-door spiders at night at Mentone.</p></div>

<p>For a few seconds the door remained tightly closed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[ 241 ]</a></span>
and then, to our great surprise, was suddenly opened
again, and the beetle was cast alive and unharmed
out of the nest. I immediately secured the insect,
which proved to be the common <i>Chrysomela Banksii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_149" id="Footnote_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> I am indebted to Mr. F. Smith for the name.</p></div>

<p>I cannot doubt that this beetle was distasteful in
some way to the spider, for it was neither so large nor
so powerful as many beetles the remains of which I
have found in the spiders' nests, and, besides, it did
not escape from the nest, but was distinctly rejected
by its captor.</p>

<p>This shows that this spider does not know instinctively
what insects to reject and what to take.</p>

<p>This little episode was scarcely ended when I
espied a wood-louse (<i>Oniscus</i>) walking down the bank,
not far from another of these wafer nests. By a little
guidance I managed so to turn its course that this
unsuspicious crustacean went straight to the very
point I wished, and made as if it would walk over the
spider's door; but no sooner was it well within reach
than, quick as thought, the spider clutched it and
dragged it in. No rejection followed on this capture,
and, though I could not actually witness the conclusion
of this adventure, I do not doubt that it ended
in a tragedy and a supper.</p>

<p>In these two cases, as in all those previously noted,
the spiders did not leave the nest nor allow the door
to close behind them, but kept it propped up on the
abdomen and hindmost pair of legs. In this way the
act of seizing their prey, and that of withdrawing
into the nest, were almost simultaneous.</p>

<p>In no case did we see any of these spiders out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[ 242 ]</a></span>
their nests, and their behaviour by night appeared to
be the same as by day, only that they were bolder
and more on the alert.</p>

<p>The spiders in the cork nests (<i>N. Moggridgii</i>) resisted
our attempts to raise their doors just as rigorously
as in the daytime.</p>

<p>All the spiders which I have kept in captivity have
shown themselves more active at night than during
the day, and I imagine that experience has taught
them that fewer of their enemies are then abroad,
while ants, beetles, wood-lice, and other creatures upon
which they prey are quite as nocturnal as themselves.</p>

<p>I brought back to England some young cork and
wafer spiders from Hy√®res, and one adult cork (<i>N.
Moggridgii</i>). The latter was placed in a small tin
box, with moss and a little earth at the bottom, on
the evening of May the 10th, 1873, and by next
morning she had made a silk tube through the moss,
carrying up earth from below for the purpose of
strengthening its walls on the outside. On the 13th
of May the tube was furnished with a perfect door.</p>

<p>I hoped that this spider might lay eggs in her
prison,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and therefore broke up her nest from time to
time after my return to London in order to search
for them. Between the 27th of May (when her nest
had been transferred into a box of earth) and the 6th
of October I destroyed her dwelling four times, and
after each demolition she furnished the cylindrical
hole which I bored for her with a lid, having thus
made five doors since her capture. I got no eggs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[ 243 ]</a></span>
however, though the spider appeared in perfect
health.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_150" id="Footnote_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150"><span class="label">[150]</span></a> Strange to say, though I have opened so many nests at different seasons of
the year, and found young apparently quite recently hatched, I have never been
able to find the eggs of a trap-door spider.</p></div>

<p>Neither this spider nor the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> of
Montpellier appears to have any idea of digging a hole
when placed on soft earth if they are adult; and the
same thing is true of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> and <i>N. Eleanora</i>,
but the young of all these spiders readily excavate
nests for themselves.</p>

<p>I have once seen a nearly full grown, and probably
adult, <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i> make a perfect tube and
furnish it with a moveable door in a single night
when confined under gauze on moist earth, but this
is the only instance (except that of <i>Cteniza Californica</i>,
recorded above) in which I have known an adult trap-door
spider excavate or attempt to do so.</p>

<p>These <i>Ctenizas</i> seem to be peculiarly able to adapt
themselves to circumstances, for two young ones,
which I sent by post to M. Lucas at the Jardin des
Plantes in Paris in little wide-mouthed, cylindrical,
blue glass bottles, not only lined the bottles with
silk but also closed them at the mouth with a door
fitting accurately into a bevelled lip, in the manufacture
of both of which fragments of moss, the only
material at their disposal, were used in place of
earth.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> It is curious to see how quickly the young
trap-door spiders, both of the cork and wafer kinds,
when taken from the nest of the mother, will make
their own perfect little dwellings in captivity, and I
have known them construct tube and door within
fifteen hours.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_151" id="Footnote_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151"><span class="label">[151]</span></a> M. H. Lucas, in <i>Bull. des S√©ances de la Soc. Entom. de Fr.</i> No. 27
(1874), p. 101.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[ 244 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>I have watched the proceedings of the young
spiders, when taken from the mother's nest, in the
following species: <i>Nemesia Manderstjern√¶</i>, <i>N. Eleanora</i>,
<i>N. congener</i>, and <i>N. Moggridgii</i>, the three first
constructing wafer, and the last a cork nest. All of
these very young spiders will excavate their own
tubes and bring out pellets of the earth, which closely
resemble those carried out from their galleries by
the ants.</p>

<p>As has been stated before, the young brood, while
still in the mother's nest, will often comprise individuals
of different sizes, and though the majority are
no larger than the baby-spider represented at Fig.
B 2, Pl. IX, <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, some may occasionally
be found that are fully twice as large.</p>

<p>The little nests which they make in captivity
vary accordingly in size. Thus, out of sixteen
young taken from the mother's nest (<i>N. Eleanora</i>),
eleven, three days after capture, had made nests in the
earth of a flower-pot, and the wafer doors of six of
these nests measured 2 lines across, of four 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
lines, and of one 3 lines. The first nests of another
similar lot of young <i>Eleanora</i> spiders had wafer doors
measuring respectively 2, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 3 and 3 lines. In
another case when I captured fourteen young (the
entire brood found in the nest of the mother, <i>N.
Manderstjern√¶</i>), after the lapse of five days every one
of them had made a nest, but these were smaller and
more uniform, ten of the wafer doors measuring 2
lines across, one 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and one 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>These little spiders need to be kept constantly supplied
with flies, which should be killed and placed near
their nests; they are often so greedy that they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[ 245 ]</a></span>
attempt to drag a house-fly entire down their tubes
for which it is much too large, when the door is
pushed open, and the fly remains sticking in the
entrance to the nest with its legs up in the air. One
may even feed these spiders oneself by approaching
carefully and, without causing any vibration, pushing
the fly, placed on the end of a pencil, within reach of
the spider.</p>

<p>I have given my reasons before (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>,
p. 127) for believing that the trap-door spiders do not
as a rule desert their nests, but enlarge them from time
to time to meet their own requirements of growth;
showing, by a comparison of the measurements of the
doors of eight nests in April with those of the same
nests in the following October, that all had increased
in size.</p>

<p>Subsequent observations have confirmed this; I find
that the young spiders taken from the mother's nest enlarge
their nests in captivity in a precisely similar way.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, the wafer doors of three young
<i>Eleanora</i> spiders, made within a few days after their
removal from the mother's nest on February 20th,
1873, and first measured on February 28th, had
increased between that date and Nov. 29th following
from 2 to 4 lines, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 4 lines, and 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 6 lines
respectively.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the male and female spiders
are undistinguishable when very young, as it would
be interesting to know whether the males construct
nests before they take to their adult life, during which
they roam from place to place and hide under stones.</p>

<p>In one case fourteen young spiders, forming this
entire family taken with a female <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[ 246 ]</a></span>
made nests; so that unless all of these were females,
we have evidence here to prove that the males do
commence life by building nests for themselves.</p>

<p>I kept the male <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i>, for ten days on
damp earth in captivity, but he made no attempt to
excavate or spin, and wandered restlessly about,
scarcely touching the flies<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> with which I supplied him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_152" id="Footnote_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152"><span class="label">[152]</span></a> I habitually fed my captive spiders with common house-flies, and it
was curious to see how entirely the latter were wanting in any instinctive
fear of even the largest spiders. They would creep between the spiders' legs,
causing them to start as if electrified, and frequently it was not until the flies,
after repeating this annoyance several times, actually walked up to and almost
touched the fangs of the spider, that they were punished for their ignorance and
presumption.</p></div>

<p>Seeing this I could not venture to prolong his
captivity, as I feared to risk injuring a specimen which
was quite unique and which there was little likelihood
of my being able to replace. It is rather curious
that M. Simon should also have found one male,
and one only, of the closely-related <i>Ct. fodiens</i> of
Corsica, and that his specimen should be, like mine,
the only one known.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the curious problems which arise
as to the affinities of the flora and fauna of the Alpes
Maritimes with that of Corsica, the fact that the
species of <i>Cteniza</i> which is found at Mentone, though
allied to, is yet distinct from the insular species, gains
a new interest.</p>

<p>We ask ourselves whether the Corsican species
sprang from that of the Alpes Maritimes, or <i>vice vers√¢</i>;
or again, whether both diverged in remote times from
a common ancestor. Questions such as these cannot
be answered at present, but I hope the day may
come when the geographical distribution of the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[ 247 ]</a></span>
existing forms of life will be traced with sufficient
accuracy to enable us to follow on the map the lines
along which affinity travels; and thus point out at
once the probable relationship between two given
forms, and also the route by which they reached their
present stations. Records of local varieties, and the
careful discrimination between forms which have
small but permanent points of difference, thus acquire
an importance which they would not otherwise possess.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of trap-door spiders
is of peculiar interest on account of the sedentary
habits maintained during life by the females. Most
animals are capable of travelling long distances, or of
being accidentally transported from place to place in
such a way that colonies are frequently established
far away from the parent settlement, and we are left
in the dark as to whence they came and who are their
nearest relations. But, in the case of spiders inhabiting
true trap-door nests, this is not so; they begin
life immediately on leaving the parent nest by
making homes for themselves near at hand which
they will not desert, and there is no likelihood of
their being accidentally carried from place to place
unless occasionally by running water. Thus it happens
that whenever we find the same trap-door
spider at two distant localities, we may feel tolerably
sure that the species has travelled from one to the
other by gradual extension, and that, either now or
in times past, it occupied all the intervening country.</p>

<p>For instance, we find <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> at Mentone,
and again at Cannes, while it has not yet been
detected at Nice, Antibes, nor any other intermediate
point; but according to this hypothesis, this species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[ 248 ]</a></span>
either does actually live, or has done so formerly, along
the whole intervening line. I will now enumerate the
species alluded to in the preceding pages and indicate
briefly the habitats which they are known with certainty
to occupy.</p>

<p>I. <i>Atypus piceus</i>, Sulzer (ex Simon). The builder
of the tubular nest the silk lining of which is
figured at A in <a href="#Plate_XIII">Pl. XIII</a> It is stated by M.
Simon<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> to be common in all the centre, east, and
west of France, but it remains doubtful whether this
exact form is found in England or not, the true
characters and habits of the English species being
still uncertain.</p>

<p>II. <i>Cyrtauchenius elongatus</i>, Simon, constructing the
funnel type of nest. It inhabits the neighbourhood
of Fez in Morocco.</p>

<p>III. <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i>, Cambridge (formerly described
under the name of <i>Ct. fodiens</i><a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>), one of the
many builders of a nest of the cork type; I have
hitherto found this spider only at Mentone and San
Remo. It will probably be discovered in shady
valleys in the neighbourhood of Nice.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_154" id="Footnote_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154"><span class="label">[154]</span></a> <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 89.</p></div>

<p>IV. <i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Camb. (<i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, Rossi ex
Simon): large nest of cork type; inhabits Corsica. It
has been said that the species found near Pisa (<i>Ct.
Sauvagii</i>) is the same as that which is so common in
Corsica, but it is desirable to have further confirmation
of this.</p>

<p>V. <i>Ct. Californica</i>, Camb.&mdash;Large nest of cork type.
Found near Visalia, about 350 miles south of San
Francisco, by Mr. G. Treadwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[ 249 ]</a></span></p>

<p>VI. <i>Nemesia c√¶mentaria</i>, Latr.&mdash;Nest of cork type.
Only known with certainty to inhabit the neighbourhood
of Montpellier.</p>

<p>VII. <i>N. Moggridgii</i>, Camb. (formerly described
under the name of <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, Latr.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>)&mdash;Nest of
cork type; is found at San Remo, Mentone, Cannes,
Hy√®res, and Marseilles. Its range probably extends
some distance to the eastwards, but I doubt whether
it does so towards the west, for there I think it likely
that it will be found to be replaced by the typical
<i>c√¶mentaria</i>.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>N. Simoni</i>, Camb.&mdash;Nest of the single-door
unbranched wafer type, discovered at Bordeaux in
May, 1874.</p>

<p>IX. <i>N. suffusa</i>, Camb.&mdash;Nest of single-door branched
wafer type, discovered at Montpellier in May, 1873.</p>

<p>X. <i>N. Eleanora</i>, Camb.&mdash;Nest of double-door unbranched
wafer type; is found at San Remo, Mentone,
Cannes, Vaucluse near Avignon. M. Simon says<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>

<p>XI. <i>N. congener</i>, Camb.&mdash;Nest of double-door
branched wafer type; discovered at Hy√®res in May,
1873.</p>

<p>XII. <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, Koch, in Ausserer (formerly
described under the name of <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa).<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>&mdash;Nest
of double-door, branched, cavity wafer type; is

Cannes, and Hy√®res (apparently very rare at the last-named
place).</p>

<p>XIII. <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa.&mdash;Structure of nest
doubtful (see description in <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 138).
Found near Naples and in Ischia. M. Simon has
discovered a spider in Corsica which he considers the
same as that described by M. Costa under the name
of <i>meridionalis</i>, but it seems desirable, in order
thoroughly to establish this conclusion, that specimens
of the spiders and their nests from these distant
habitats should be compared together.</p>

<p>We can scarcely suppose that the real geographical
distribution of the above-named twelve species is as
restricted as it would appear to be from the above
enumeration, and there is little doubt, I think, that
many more habitats will be added in time. Indeed,
our knowledge of the habits and distribution of these
spiders can only as yet be said to be in its infancy,
the whole subject being, for the most part, new and
untrodden ground.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, what are the chances in the
future for the discovery of undescribed spiders and
types of nests: and what reward of this kind may the
travelling naturalist expect in order to compensate
him for the time and pains which such a search
demands, and which must divert him in a great
measure from making other collections?</p>

<p>The reply is not doubtful.</p>

<p>Europe alone, most probably, contains many trap-door
spiders the specific characters and habits of which
are at present unknown; and as for the warmer
regions of other parts of the globe, we only know
enough to lead us to surmise that still stranger and
more startling discoveries await us there.</p>

<p>Dr. L. Koch's description of the very remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[ 251 ]</a></span>
branched-wafer nest from Australia, alluded to above
(p. 217), and the fragmentary specimens of giant cork-nests
from the same country exhibited at the British
Museum, give us a hint of what the Antipodes will
some day reveal to us; while a stray allusion to a
trap-door nest found near Lake Dilolo, in Southern
Africa, by Livingstone,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> affords an indication of their
existence in another quarter of the globe. Hitherto
but little importance has been attached by naturalists
to the study of the nests of trap-door spiders, but a
knowledge of their structure is often of the greatest
assistance, and will, I venture to predict, be found to
afford a clue leading to the discovery of many new
species; for it not unfrequently happens that, while
two spiders appear so much alike as to pass for representatives
of the same species, their nests are totally
dissimilar and proclaim them, as in fact they are,
quite distinct from one another. For an example of
this we have only to turn to the seven species of
<i>Nemesia</i>, treated of in the foregoing pages, of which
six construct dissimilar nests, and only two, building
nests of the cork type, make them alike, though the
general resemblance between the spiders themselves
is extraordinarily close. Thus far, indeed, it will be
seen that no two distinct species of European trap-door
spider make wafer nests of the same type,
each kind of wafer nest having its own peculiar
spider.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_158" id="Footnote_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> "A large reddish spider (<i>Mygale</i>), named by the natives 'scl√†li,' runs about
with great velocity. Its nest is most ingeniously covered with a hinged cover
or door, about the size of a shilling, the inner face of which is of a pure white
silky substance like paper, while the outer one is coated with earth precisely
like that in which the hole is made, so that when it is closed it is quite impossible
to detect the situation of the nest. Unfortunately the cavity for breeding is
never seen except when the owner is out, and has left the door open behind her."&mdash;<i>Dr.
Livingstone</i>, <i>from</i> "<i>Popular Accounts of Travels in South Africa</i>," chap.
xvii. p. 221.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[ 252 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>This strikes me as a very curious fact, and I await
with interest the discovery of new species of wafer-building
spiders in order to learn whether this will
continue to hold good or not.</p>

<p>That such discoveries will be made I entertain
no doubt; indeed, I have reason to believe that, even
at Mentone, where perhaps more pairs of eyes have
been at work searching for trap-door spiders than
anywhere else, new species still remain to be detected.
In April, 1873, the surface door of a wafer-nest
together with a very small portion of the tube was
brought to me from the summit of the Aiguille
mountain, near Mentone. I was greatly surprised to
learn that a trap-door spider could live in such a
situation, for the earth on that plateau, which has an
elevation of 4032 feet above the sea, is always frozen
hard for weeks and even months together during the
winter, and snow frequently lingers there. The
spider, therefore, which endures these conditions is
scarcely likely to be of the same species as any one of
those inhabiting the lower country. The trap-door
spiders of these spurs of the Maritime Alps, are
probably of distinct species from those of the plains,
but they are absolutely unknown at present.</p>

<p>Then the males of several species, as, for example,
those of <i>Nemesia Simoni</i>, <i>N. suffusa</i>, <i>N. congener</i>, and
<i>N. Moggridgii</i>, have yet to be discovered; while of
the habits of the males in general we know little or
nothing.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is no one species with the habits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[ 253 ]</a></span>
which we can say we are thoroughly acquainted, and we
must admit that up to the present time these ingenious
little architects have been at least as successful in
concealing themselves from the intrusion of naturalists
as from the attacks of their proper enemies.</p>

<p>Surely these trap-door spiders, which have lain
quiet in the earth century after century, have hidden
themselves long enough from our inquisitive admiration,
and the time has now come for us to seek them
out and learn their ways.</p>

<p>Adult male length 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines, length of cephalothorax
3 lines, breadth 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The cephalothorax is of a short, broad-oval form,
its length being only half a line greater than its
breadth; it is flattened-convex above, and depressed
near the margins, the <i>caput</i> (when looked at in profile)
scarcely rising above the level of the thorax. At the
junction of the caput and thoracic segments is a deep,
circularly-curved indentation, or fovea, the curve of
which is directed backwards; the extremities of this
indentation are continued obliquely forwards on either
side, forming the normal ones which indicate the junction
of the caput and thorax. Rather more than one-third
of the distance between the above curved indentation
and the fore margin of the caput is a very
perceptible and deep but narrow, slightly curved,
transverse indentation which divides the caput into
two distinct parts; the curve of this indentation is
directed forwards. The normal thoracic indentations
are well marked, but not very strong; the surface of
the thorax, though shining, appeared under a lens to
be covered with fine rugulosities. Its colour is yellow-brown;
a large triangular patch on either side of the
caput being tinged with orange, and the rest suffused
with dark brown. The caput is of a dark reddish
yellow-brown, showing (in spirit of wine) two longitudinal
bars, or strong lines, of a clearer orange yellow-brown
colour; its surface is glossy, though, under a lens,
the sides of the fore part are very finely striated or rugulose.
These lines begin behind the extremities of the
hinder row of eyes, and gradually converge to a
point at the thoracic junction; the ocular region and
central longitudinal line of the fore-segment of the
caput have some long and very prominent black
bristles. When alive, the cephalothorax appears to
have been suffused with a purplish hue, corresponding
to that of the abdomen and other parts.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> form a rectangular figure, whose fore side
is a little shorter than the hinder one, and whose
transverse, or longest, diameter is as nearly as possible
double the length of its shortest one; the eyes of
the central or fore-central pair are small, and separated
by a diameter's distance from each other. The
hind laterals are the smallest of the eight, and each
is almost contiguous to the hind-central nearest to it,
this latter being of a sub-triangular form, and separated
from the fore-central on its side by an interval
equal to that which divides the two fore-centrals, but
less than that which separates each fore-central from
the fore-lateral on its side. Looked at as in two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[ 256 ]</a></span>
transverse rows of four each, those of the foremost
row are darkish coloured, while those of the hinder
row are pearly white. Omitting the eyes of the hind-central
pair, the remaining three on either side form
as nearly as possible an equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are long, moderately strong, their relative
length being 4, 1, 2, 3. They are of a dark brown
colour, generally paler on the under sides, furnished
with hairs, fine bristles, and spines; the latter are
numerous and strong beneath the metatarsi and tibi√¶
of the first and second pairs; on those of the third
pair they are less strong and more uniformly disposed;
on those of the fourth pair they are fewest and least
conspicuous. The genual joints of the third pair
have some strongish spines on the outer side; the
right leg has eight, the left nine. The toothing of
the superior tarsal claws does not appear to be uniform
on the different legs of the same example; on those of
the fourth pair there were five teeth; on those of the
first pair eight or nine, with two others, quite rudimentary,
towards the point of the claw; and even on one
of the fourth pair of legs one of the claws had six, the
other five teeth. The tarsal claws of the second pair are
toothed throughout nearly their whole length with from
eight to ten teeth; on <i>one</i> of the third pair the teeth
were but five or six, while on the other there were on
one claw but three ordinary teeth and a much stronger
one a little way off in front of them, on the second
claw only a single strong tooth about the middle, and
a smaller one close to its base.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are long and rather slender, measuring
rather over six lines in length; they are similar in
colour to the legs, and excepting a few&mdash;from twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[ 257 ]</a></span>
to fourteen&mdash;short strong spines on the upper side of
the extremity of the digital joint, furnished with hairs
only. The cubital joint is more than half the length
of the radial; this latter is equal in length to the
humeral joint, and nearly as long as the femora of
the first pair of legs. The digital joint is short, of
an oblong oval form, broadest at its extremity. The
palpal organs consist of a nearly spherical corneous
lobe, prolonged at its fore extremity into a long,
slender, tapering, beak-like spine, curving upwards
(<i>i.e.</i>, with its point near to the radial joint), and
inwards.</p>

<p>A broad, conspicuous, shining, corneous band, of a
deeper red-brown than the rest, runs round the middle
(or equatorial line) of the spherical portion of these
organs, covering the greater part of their surface.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are of moderate length and strength,
and of ordinary form. They are similar in colour to
the legs, and furnished in front, chiefly on their inner
edges, with hairs, and at their extremities on the inner
sides, with a few, but not very strong nor conspicuous,
short spines; their under side (along which the fang
lies) is toothed on the inner edge only; the fang is
strong and curved, but presents nothing remarkable
in form, nor could I detect either denticulation or
serration.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill√¶</i> are strong, straight, divergent, with a
small prominent point at the inner extremity of each;
they are as strong, but not so long, as the basal (coxal)
joints of the legs of the first pair, of a yellow-brown
colour, furnished with hairs, but with no spines of
any sort or size.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is similar in colour to the maxill√¶, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[ 258 ]</a></span>
somewhat quadrate in shape, rounded at the apex; it
is furnished with hairs only.</p>

<p>The <i>sternum</i> is of a sub-pentagonal form, much
broader behind than in front; its colour is dull yellowish-brown,
and it is furnished with hairs, leaving
two largish, bare, round, slightly impressed patches,
not far from each other, in a transverse line near the
middle.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is short-oval in form, and very convex
above; it projects a little over the base of the cephalothorax,
and its upper side is of a purplish grey-brown
hue, mottled with a pale dull whitish-yellow, and furnished
sparingly with hairs. The sides and under
side are of a uniform dull whitish-yellow. The
<i>spinners</i> (four in number) are, as usual, of very unequal
size, those of the superior pair longish, strong, three-jointed,
and up-turned, the inferior pair short but
stout, consisting of one joint only and pretty close
together.</p>

<p>The <i>female</i> (as it is conjectured to be) of this
species was described, in the work to which the
present publication is supplementary, from examples
found at Mentone. There is little doubt now but
that it is not <i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Walck., but whether or not
identical with the male above described is not absolutely
certain. I think myself (with Mr. Moggridge,
see <a href="#Page_195">p. 195</a>) that it is so, in spite of some differences
in the relative size of the eyes, the toothing of the
under side of the falces, and the denticulation of
the tarsal claws. With regard to the eyes and
falces, I am not inclined to lay special stress upon
these differences. It is found that in other groups
of spiders whose cephalothorax varies very markedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[ 259 ]</a></span>
in development in the two sexes, differences of
this nature occur. In the present genus, the male
has an almost flat caput, while the female has a
strongly elevated one; and with respect to the variation
in the tarsal claws, no special weight can be
attached to it in the present instance, since these
claws are not uniformly denticulated in the different
feet of the same individual. Another difference is the
absence in the male of sundry small but distinct
tooth-like spines at the apex of the labium and the
inner corner of the base of the maxill√¶; the female
is also wanting in regard to the very characteristic
transverse indentation which divides the caput of the
male into two parts. I can, however, trace in the
female the slightest possible corresponding depression,
scarcely amounting to an indentation, and placed
rather nearer to the junctional thoracic pit.</p>

<p>With regard to the differences between this species
and <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, Latr. (<i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Walck.), size alone
would suffice to distinguish them; two females of the
latter now before me measuring 13 lines in length;
while the male (<i>Aran. nouv. ou peu connus du Midi de
l'Europe</i>, par Eug√®ne Simon, M√©m., Li√®ge, 1873)
measures 8 lines (17 mm.) and the female rather over
14 lines (30 mm.), the fore-central eyes in the female
of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i> appeared to be smaller than those in
<i>Ct. Moggridgii</i> and placed rather farther forwards, but
the eyes in both are otherwise remarkably similar
both in size and position. The males, however,
cannot be confounded inasmuch as, according to M.
Simon, no trace of any transverse indentation on the
caput exists in <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>.</p>

<p>The denticulation of the tarsal claws in the females
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[ 260 ]</a></span>
of both species is similar, but M. Simon does not
mention this portion of the structure of the male he
describes of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>.</p>

<p>The adult male of <i>Ct. Moggridgii</i> above described,
was found behind the stones of an old wall at Mentone,
but not in any kind of nest.</p>

<p>Nest-making, and excavating for that purpose, is,
probably, no part of the work of the adult males in
this and other allied genera, and hence we can see a
reason for differences in the development of the caput,
and the denticulation of the falces. The usual habitat
of the females and their nests is in damp and shady
spots, whereas <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i> constructs its nests in dry
exposed banks.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Habitat.</i> Mentone and San Remo.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cteniza Californica</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>, fig. B,
p. 198.</p>

<p>Adult female; length very nearly 14 lines; length
of the cephalothorax, 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>; greatest breadth of ditto, 5;
breadth of fore part of caput, 4 lines; length of caput
rather over 3 lines.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> of this spider is rather broader
in proportion to its length than that of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>,
Walck., Sim. = <i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Walck. The convexity, or
elevation, of the caput is also less, but that of the
thorax is greater, so that (when looked at in profile)
the profile line of the two forms a tolerably even and
continuous slope, interrupted only by the thoracic
fovea; the profile, however, of the occiput is curved.</p>

<p>The thoracic fovea, or junctional indentation, is
strong, deep, and semilunar in form, the horns of
the crescent pointing forwards; the other normal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[ 261 ]</a></span>
indentations are well marked, but those which divide
the caput from the first thoracic segment do not unite
with the extremities of the junctional fovea, being
in this respect unlike <i>Ct. Moggridgii</i>, but more like
<i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>. The <i>clypeus</i>, although transversely impressed,
yet slopes forward more gradually than in
either of those species, its breadth is about equal to
that of the ocular area, or amounts to half that of the
facial space. The colour of the cephalothorax, taken
from the specimen preserved in spirit of wine, is a
deep reddish-yellow brown, gradually getting paler
towards the margins. When alive, I understand that
the general colour of the whole spider was a dark
blackish chocolate brown, the legs and cephalothorax
being darker than the abdomen; there are a few
prominent bristly hairs in the medial line both before
and behind the ocular area.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> form a narrow transverse oblong figure,
its length being about two and a half times its width,
and its fore side is a little the shortest; the fore-lateral
eyes are large and oval, and by far the largest of
the eight; the rest do not differ much in size, though
perhaps the hind laterals, which are also oval, are a
little the largest; the longest diameter of these, however,
is less than half the longest diameter of the fore
laterals. The interval between the fore and hind
laterals is small, only equal to the shortest diameter
of the hind lateral; and this interval is nearly double
that which separates each hind lateral and the hind
central nearest to it. The hind laterals and hind
centrals form an almost perfectly straight line, the
former being very slightly indeed within the straight
line of the former; the intervals which separate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[ 262 ]</a></span>
fore centrals from each other, and each of them from
the fore lateral on its side, are as nearly as possible
equal, though very slightly, if at all, less than that
which separates each of them from the hind central
on its side: the interval which separates the fore
laterals is double the length of the longest diameter
of one of them.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are short and very strong; they are like
the cephalothorax in colour, but paler underneath the
femora; this joint in the third pair is proportionally
much stronger than in the other legs; all are furnished
with hairs, bristles, and spines, a group of
erect bristles among the rest occupies the fore part of
the upper side of the metatarsi of the first and second
pairs; strong spines of different lengths are thickly
placed beneath and on the lower part of the sides of
the tibi√¶ tarsi and metatarsi of the first and second
pairs. On the tarsi and metatarsi of the third and
fourth pairs similar spines are distributed more uniformly
over the whole surface of the joints, and on
the genual joint of the 3rd pair there is one short
strong spine near its extremity on the outer side,
those on the tibi√¶ both of the third and fourth pairs
being confined to a few on the outer side, and towards
the lower side only. Each tarsus terminates with
three claws, of which the two superior ones have
a single strong tooth towards the base on the lower
side.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are rather long, strong, and similar in
colour to the legs. They are furnished with hairs,
bristles, and spines; of the latter the radial and
digital joints have some short and strong ones, pretty
thickly grouped along both their outer and inner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[ 263 ]</a></span>
sides; the digital joint ends with a single untoothed
claw.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are strong and massive, more so than in
<i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, but of normal form. They are furnished
with hairs and bristles, and with strong spines near
their inner extremities on the upper side; the fangs
are strong, folded along the under side of the falces
in a furrow which is toothed along either edge. The
colour of the falces is a rich deep red-brown.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill√¶</i> are strong, straight, divergent, with a
prominent point at the inner extremity, and some
very short, strong, tooth-like spines at their base;
their colour is dull yellow-brown, and, with the labium
and sternum, they are thickly clothed with short
strong hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is dark yellow-brown, tipped slightly
with black; it is of a somewhat semilunar form, and
has a few very short tooth-like spines near its apex.</p>

<p>The <i>sternum</i> is of a rough oval form, broadest
behind and shorter and broader in proportion than
that of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i> and <i>Ct. Moggridgii</i>; its colour is
dull yellow-brown, and it is destitute of the two
shining bare patches conspicuous in both those
species.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is large, short-oval, broadest behind
and very convex above; it is of a dull yellowish-brown
colour, thickly mottled with minute dark points
seen through a lens to be little rings, from the centre
of each of which springs a bristly hair; the underside
is paler; the spinners and spiracular openings are
normal. As observed above, the colour of the abdomen
was rather different in life; it was then of a
deep blackish chocolate brown, with an indistinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[ 264 ]</a></span>
longitudinal line along the middle of its fore part on
the upper side, intersected by a similar line at right
angles; but these lines soon disappeared after death;
the specimen had been in spirit of wine some months
before the present description was made.</p>

<p>A single example, with its tubular nest of the cork-lid
type, was received alive from California in 1873,
and appears to have been hitherto undescribed;
though no larger than <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, it is yet a
stouter and more massive spider, and may readily
be distinguished by the large size of its fore-lateral
eyes, the narrower ocular area arising from the far
greater proximity to each other of the eyes of each
lateral pair, the less convexity of the caput, and the
greater convexity of the thorax, as well as by its
being altogether a darker coloured spider, and having
shorter stouter legs.</p>

<p>Adult female, length 7 to 9 lines.</p>

<p><i>Cephalothorax</i> oval, truncated and almost equally
broad at each end; the upper surface is moderately
convex, the caput elevated a little above the rest, and
equally rounded on the sides and upper part; the
profile of the whole cephalothorax forms a general
sloping slightly curved line, broken by the thoracic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[ 265 ]</a></span>
junctional pit or fovea, which is narrow but strong,
and gently but equally curved, the convexity of the
curve directed forwards; the thorax next to this
fovea is rather gibbous, but not over any great extent
of surface; the other normal indentations are tolerably
strong; the colour of the cephalothorax is
yellow-brown, darkest on the sides of the caput, and
along the thoracic indentations, palest on the margins,
forming a pale marginal border indistinctly vandyked
on the inner edge. The surface is clothed, but not
densely, with yellowish-grey adpressed hairs; there are
a few black bristles in a straight transverse line, directed
forwards from the lower margin of the clypeus; also a
few more bristles curved and of various lengths before
and behind the ocular area, their points meeting over
this area, and a row of strong, nearly erect ones in a
longitudinal central line from the ocular area to the
junctional fovea; besides these are a few more, finer
and less conspicuous, along the middle both of the
caput and thorax; the colour on either side and in
front of the ocular area is orange yellow-brown, and
joining with this a broad band of the same runs backwards
from the ocular area to the thoracic fovea.
The band begins as wide as this area, it then directly
enlarges a little, and thence tapers slightly and gradually
to its termination, forming a truncate wedge,
with the margins rather irregular, but on the whole
a little curved. This band is not immaculate, there
being two dark yellow-brown tapering lines or bars
along the greater part of its length; these bars begin
from each outer pair of eyes of the hinder row, and
tapering to a fine line, converge to the thoracic fovea,
but do not quite meet. It is important to note the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[ 266 ]</a></span>
exact form and distribution of the central band and
these tapering bars, as their differences from the
character of the similar part in another closely allied
species are strongly specific; the above description
holds good in above twenty examples before me.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are in two transverse lines, forming an
area whose length is rather less than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times its
width; the foremost line is curved, and the curve
directed backwards, the hinder one is also curved and in
a similar direction, but less strongly, looking laterally
the extreme margin of the four eyes of the hinder row
forms a straight line. Considered as in pairs, those of
the fore-central pair are separated by an interval equal
to that which separates each from the fore-lateral and
hind-central nearest to it; the fore-laterals are divided
by about two and a half diameters; they are the largest
of the eight, only slightly however, in some examples,
larger than the hind-laterals. Each of them is separated
from the hind-lateral on its side by not quite
half the diameter of the latter, and each hind-lateral
is very nearly but not quite contiguous to the hind-central
on its side; the hind-centrals are roughly
rounded, smallest of the eight, though in some examples
equal in size to the fore-centrals, and are separated
from the fore-central nearest to it by about one
diameter, which gives a clue to the absolute distance
between the eyes of the foremost pair. The four
lateral eyes are oval, the fore-centrals round; those
of the foremost row are darkish coloured, while those
of the hinder row are pearly white.</p>

<p>Although it is of great importance to observe as
accurately as possible the relative position and size of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[ 267 ]</a></span>
the eyes, yet we must be prepared to find exceptions
to the rule derived from the most exact measurements
in any individual instance.</p>

<p>In the present species the above conclusions, as to
position and size, are drawn from a consideration and
comparison of 20 examples, and are, it is believed,
pretty true, but yet in one example, one of the hind
central eyes was but half the size of the other, and in
another example one of the same eyes was but one-fourth
of that of the other, a mere dot in fact, and the
relative size of the respective lateral eyes of the two
rows do not appear to maintain exactly the same
proportions in all individuals. The height of the
clypeus appeared to be as nearly as possible half that
of the facial space.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are strong, moderately long, their relative
length 4, 1, 2, 3, though in some examples those of the
second and third pairs are equal in length; in others,
those of the third pair are slightly longer than those
of the second; here again, as with the eyes, although
the relative proportion of the legs of spiders is an
important specific point, and in general tolerably
reliable, yet accurate observation and measurements
prove that there are small differences in individual
instances. The legs are yellow-brown in colour, furnished
with hairs, bristles, and a few spines. The
outer sides of the genual joints of the third pair are
destitute of spines; in two instances only out of 20,
this joint had a single, not very conspicuous, spine.
The superior tarsal claws have 4-5 minute pectinations
underneath near their base.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are moderately long and strong, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[ 268 ]</a></span>
similar in colour and general armature to the legs;
they terminate with a single, strong, sharply curved
untoothed claw.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are of a deep black red-brown colour,
strong and prominent, and flat, but not cut away, on
their inner sides; they are furnished on their upper
sides with black bristles and yellowish-grey hairs,
disposed in longitudinal lines; these bristles are
strongest and most numerous on the inner margin of
the upper side, increasing in strength forwards where,
near the extremity, are some strong spines.</p>

<p>On the inner edge of the under side of each falx is
a row of teeth, and each fang is also denticulate or
finely serrate, beneath towards its hinder part.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill√¶</i> are strong, cylindrical, and divergent;
and each has a small bluntish angular prominence at
the extremity on the inner side; their inner margin has
a thick fringe of pale reddish hairs, the fore surface
being clothed (as ordinarily) with dark bristly hairs,
and there are a few black minute tooth-like spines in
a line (sometimes in a small group) near the inner
corner of their base.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is short, broad, its breadth nearly double
its length, and the upper corners rather rounded off;
there are some strongish bristles, mostly towards the
apex, but no tooth-like spines nor denticulations.</p>

<p>The <i>sternum</i> is oval, rather convex, broadest towards
the hinder part, which is pointed at this extremity
but hollow-truncate before.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is sparingly clothed with hairs; it is
of a stoutish regular oval form, and of a dull brownish
yellow colour; its fore extremity on the upper side is
thickly blotched with deep blackish-brown, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[ 269 ]</a></span>
whole length spanned by a series of about five curved,
or slightly angular, stoutish bars or chevrons, formed
of more or less confluent, dark, blackish-brown blotches
and markings; a more or less indistinct line of a
similar nature also divides the fore part of the upper
side of the abdomen longitudinally. There is some
variety in the extent, depth, and distinctness of these
markings, but the figures given (<a href="#Plate_XIX">Pl. XIX</a>, p. 229,
figs. B, B 1) show the appearance of an average
example.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this description is
made from examples in spirit of wine, and that in life
the markings (especially on the cephalothorax) are
often considerably obscured by the hairs on the surface;
when seen through spirit the actual tints of colour
are sometimes misrepresented, but the characteristic
markings are seen more distinctly.</p>

<p>The lower part of the sides and the underside of
the abdomen are of a uniform pale dull brownish-yellow;
the spinners of the superior pair are short,
strong, and 2-jointed; those of the inferior pair are very
minute, and near together at the base of, and almost
between, the others.</p>

<p>Adult and immature females were found in 1873-4
abundantly at Montpellier in France, in unbranched
tubular nests closed at the surface with a close-fitting
"cork" lid.</p>

<p>In <i>Harvesting Ants and Trap-door Spiders</i>, p. 92, a
spider inhabiting similar nests, and found commonly
at <i>Cannes</i> and Mentone was described as <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
Latr. The subsequent discovery however of a
very closely allied, but certainly distinct, species in
abundance at Montpellier (the locality in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[ 270 ]</a></span>
original <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, Latr., was found) makes it
more than probable that the <i>Montpellier</i>, and not the
Mentone, species is the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>. Certainly
as yet no other species more likely than this to be
the one described by Latreille has been found at
Montpellier; in fact, the one here described is the
common one found there, and alone answers to
Latreille's character of having a nest with a lid of
the cork type.</p>

<p>It has become therefore necessary now to record
the Mentone species under another name, and under
that name, "<i>N. Moggridgii</i>" (p. 273) will be noted the
specific differences by which the two species may be
at once distinguished from each other.</p>

<p>The male of the spider here described has not been
yet found. A description is given (p. 276) of a
male spider, <i>Nemesia incerta</i> (no doubt closely allied),
found by M. Eug√®ne Simon at Digne; but reasons
will be given why it is not probable that this Digne
spider should be, as conjectured by M. Simon, the
male of the Montpellier species. Whether the <i>N.
carminans</i> (Latr.) is the male of <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> (Latr.)
or not, is another question, and one surrounded with
some obscurity and difficulty. Latreille described <i>N.
c√¶mentaria</i> (female) from Montpellier, and <i>N. carminans</i>
(male) from Aix in Provence; the latter being specially
characterized by a bifid point to the prolongation
of the palpal bulb; L. Dufour appears subsequently
to have considered <i>N. carminans</i>, Latr. (male)
to be the male of <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, and Latreille
appears to have agreed with L. Dufour upon this,
<i>vide</i> Walck. <i>Ins. Apt.</i>, i. p. 236; but Dufour afterwards
(<i>Ann. Gen. Sc. Phys.</i>, tom. v. Bruxelles, 1820,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[ 271 ]</a></span>
p. 103) introduced an element of confusion into the
question by describing <i>N. carminans</i> as having the
point of the palpal organs simple, "nullement bifid,"
and throwing out a suggestion that it might be the
male of <i>N. Sauvagii</i>, Latr., (= <i>N. pionni√®re</i> or
<i>fodiens</i>, Walck.) Latreille upon this (<i>Vues g√©n√©rales
sur les Aran√©ides, Acad. Roy. des Sc.</i>, 1830, pp. 64,
65) explains Dufour's suggestion as an inadvertence,
but takes no notice of the difference of the form of
the palpal organs as described by him; at the same
time however Latreille explains why, probably, Walckenaer
"still considers (in his <i>Faune fran√ßaise</i>) <i>N.
carminans</i> to be a distinct species." We may conclude
from this that Latreille never altered <i>his</i> opinion
that his own <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> and <i>N. carminans</i> were
the two sexes of the same species; and we shall probably
rightly agree with Walckenaer that Dufour had
another species before him, which he wrongly (l.c.)
described as <i>N. carminans</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently again a male and female spider, evidently
of one species, were figured by Dug√®s to
illustrate <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> male and female in Cuvier's
<i>R√®gne Animal</i>&mdash;Edition in 20 vols. not numbered
and without date, published in Paris, "<i>accompagn√©e
de Planches par une r√©union de disciples de Cuvier,
MM. Audouin, Blanchard, Deshayes, Aleide d'Orbigny,
Doy√®re, Dug√®s, Duvernoy, Laurillard, Milne Edwards,
Roulin, et Valenciennes</i>." Of these figures, that of the
male has the point of the palpal organs distinctly bifid,
and the nest figured is of the cork-lid type.</p>

<p>On the whole it may be concluded that the male
of the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, Latr., will be found to
have the bifid point to the palpal organs, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[ 272 ]</a></span>
question cannot be considered settled until further
researches at Montpellier and Aix (in Provence) shall
have furnished <i>males</i> of the <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> now described,
and <i>females</i> of the bifid pointed male&mdash;<i>N.
carminans</i>, Latr.&mdash;for of course it is possible that
Latreille's <i>first</i> views of the distinctness of <i>c√¶mentaria</i>
and <i>carminans</i> may be the correct ones.</p>

<p>The characters of the species now described accord
so well with the figures of the female in Dug√®s' plate
(above mentioned) that little doubt can be entertained
of <i>their</i> identity, and if so there would seem to be
little doubt also, but that further research at Montpellier
will reveal a male similar to the male figured
by Dug√®s.</p>

<p>There is but little to add to the descriptions given
(l.c. <i>supra</i>). It must however be noted that the
spines on the outer side of the genual joints of the
third pair of legs, then supposed to be a characteristic
of the present species only, are now found to exist in
several others, with some small exceptions in regard to
number, and also in respect to strict uniformity, on
both legs of the same individual. In <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>
(p. 264), however, there is rarely found even a single
spine on either of these joints; and not one out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[ 273 ]</a></span>
ten examples of another species, <i>N. Simoni</i> (p. 297),

Ants and Trap-door Spiders</i>, (by J. T. Moggridge),
p. 93, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/64654/64654-h/64654-h.htm#Plate_VIII">Pl. VIII</a></p>

<p>This spider is exceedingly closely allied to the
foregoing and was thought to be the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
Latr., until subsequent researches at Montpellier
(the locality where Latreille's types were found)
have resulted in the belief that the Montpellier,
rather than the Mentone species, is that described by
him. At present the females only of the two species
are known, and these may readily be distinguished by
the pattern on the caput.</p>

<p>In the foregoing (the <i>Montpellier Spider</i>) a broad
orange yellow-brown band runs from the ocular area
to the thoracic fovea, tapering gradually to that part,
where it is truncated, forming a wedge with the point
cut off. This wedge-shaped band is charged with two
longitudinal, more or less distinct, dark brown irregularly-tapering
lines, running throughout its whole
length and converging towards each other but not
touching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[ 274 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Mentone Spider</i> there are three orange-yellow-brown
well-defined bars or longitudinal lines between
the ocular area and the thoracic fovea; the central
bar tapers and reaches from the eyes to the fovea, the
lateral ones never more than two-thirds of the distance
from it to the eyes, diverging a little from the central
bar as they run forwards. These two lateral bars are
not straight, <i>i.e.</i>, their margins are more or less
notched or roughly angular, forming in some examples
a line of a somewhat zigzag or bent character. It may
perhaps be observed that when the two dark brown
lines which run along the broad orange-yellow-brown
band on the caput of the Montpellier spider, are well
marked, this also leaves three longitudinal yellow
lines, somewhat similar to those just described in the
Mentone species, but there is this difference even then
(and it is constant throughout a long series of examples),
the lateral lines in the Montpellier spider
<i>always run through to the eyes</i>, equalling in length the
central line, while in the Mentone spider the <i>lateral
bars never reach the eyes</i>, always stopping short of the
ocular area, by one-half, or nearly so, of their length.</p>

<p>Another distinction which appears constant is the
form of the thoracic fovea; in the Montpellier species
this forms a slight but uniform curve; in the Mentone
spider it is more sharply bent at the apex (or
centre of the curve), forming in most examples a
bluntish-angular line.</p>

<p>In the eyes there appears to be but little reliable
difference; if there be any at all constant, it seems to
be that in the present (Mentone) species the fore-laterals
are constantly smaller than the hind-laterals,
and sometimes smaller than the fore-centrals. A close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[ 275 ]</a></span>
examination, however, of the relative size and position
of the eyes in a series of examples, lowers one's estimation
of the <i>absolute</i> value of this character in the
determination of the species of <i>Nemesia</i>; still it is a
specific character not by any means to be overlooked,
though to be used guardedly, and often with great
reservation.</p>

<p>In regard to other characters and general description
there seems but little to add to the description given
(l.c. <i>supra</i>), except that the labium has no denticulations
at its apex and the outer sides of the genual
joints of the third pair of legs are generally without
spines. Occasionally (in one example out of sixteen)
there is a single spine on this joint, of either the right
or left leg. In this character, however (differing from
several others described below), the Montpellier spider
agrees with that from Mentone.</p>

<p>In both spiders, the fangs of the falces are (in some
instances at least) denticulated. Also in regard to the
relative lengths of the legs, like those of the Montpellier
spider, the second and third pairs of the
Mentone species are not constant in their relative
proportions, though the differences either way are
very slight, and there is often no difference whatever.</p>

<p>The nest and habits of the two species appear to be
nearly, if not quite, similar.</p>

<p>In naming the present species (at the suggestion of
M. Eug√®ne Simon) the writer of these descriptions
gladly testifies to his appreciation of the great value
attaching to Mr. Traherne Moggridge's investigations
of the habits of the closely-allied species of this very
difficult, though most interesting group of spiders.</p>

<p>M. Eug√®ne Simon (<i>Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr.</i> 1873, Bull, c.),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[ 276 ]</a></span>
perceiving the difference between the present species
and the one known to himself as <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, Latr.,
concludes it to be identical with <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Sim.
Examples, however, of this latter, from M. Simon's
cabinet, show that they are very distinct.</p>

<p>On <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Sim., see p. 289; and on
<i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, Sim., p. 280, M. Simon has, I understand,
subsequently admitted the error of his conclusion,
published l.c. <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Habitat.</i> San Remo, Mentone, Cannes, Hy√®res, and

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia incerta</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>, fig. D, p. 229.</p>

<p>Adult male, length slightly above 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines.</p>

<p><i>Cephalothorax</i> oval, truncate at each end; moderately
convex above, the profile line forming a pretty
even, sloping, curved line, but flattish in the middle
near the thoracic fovea, which is of a strongly curved
form; the other normal indentations are not strong,
though fairly defined; the colour of the cephalothorax
is yellow-brown, palish and clothed with
yellowish-grey adpressed hairs on the margins, and inclining
to orange on the caput. The clypeus is
somewhat steep, about equal to half the height of
the facial space, and the sides of the caput are
dark blackish-brown, leaving a longitudinal, central
reddish orange-brown band tapering to the thoracic
fovea.</p>

<p>The upper and hinder part of the thorax is
strongly suffused with brown, leaving broad but
irregular pale lateral margins; there is a group of
strong bristles directed forwards from the margin
of the clypeus, and two or three more in the median
line behind the ocular area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[ 277 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are on a strongish oblong dark brown
transverse tubercular eminence; the fore-laterals are
rather smaller than the hind-laterals, and the fore-centrals
are larger than the hind-centrals, the latter
being much the smallest of the eight; the interval
between those of each lateral pair is about equal to,
or slightly larger than, the diameter of one of the
fore-central eyes; the intervals between the four eyes
of the front row are equal, each interval being equal
to the diameter of one of the fore-centrals; and each
hind-central eye is separated from the fore-central
nearest to it by as nearly as possible a similar distance,
and from the hind-lateral on its side by a very small
but distinct interval.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are rather long, strong, of a brownish-yellow
colour, suffused with blackish-brown on the
upper sides of the femora, and furnished with hairs,
bristles, and spines. Those of the hinder (fourth) pair
were wanting, the relative lengths of the others being
1, 2, 3; 2 and 3 being very nearly equal. The spines
are not numerous, being disposed mostly on the tibi√¶
and metatarsi of the third pair; some, however, had
been evidently broken off; all the tarsi were without
spines; each tarsus ends with three claws, the superior
pair with several&mdash;6-8?&mdash;teeth on their under
sides.</p>

<p>The tibial joint of each of the first pair is short, no
longer than the genual joint, but it is strong and
enlarged gradually beneath to its fore extremity,
where it ends in a strong, sharp-pointed, tapering
red-brown curved spine, directed downwards, forwards,
and inwards. Each tarsus of the first and second pairs
is pretty thickly fringed just below on each side along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[ 278 ]</a></span>
its whole length, with short strongish hairs of an
even length.</p>

<p>On the outer side of the genual joint of the third
pair (left leg) are three spines in a longitudinal row;
the other leg of this pair was wanting.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are moderately long, and similar in colour
and general armature to the legs; the radial joint is
strong, a little tapering forwards, and somewhat curved
underneath towards its hinder part; its length is about
double that of the digital joint, and from its fore
extremity on the upper side, three strong, somewhat
sessile, spines of equal length, and directed forwards
issue, in a straight transverse line.</p>

<p>The palpal organs consist of a roundish corneous
bulb drawn out into a longish, tapering, curved,
sharp-pointed spine, the point being very fine, gradual,
and directed outwards.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are strong, prominent, of a deep red-brown
colour, furnished above with dull greyish-yellow
hairs mixed with dark bristles, and disposed in longitudinal
stripes; and near the upper extremity on the
inner side are four strongish spines.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill√¶</i> are strong, divergent, cylindrical, with
a small angular prominence at their inner extremity;
they are furnished with hairs, but no denticulations,
and there is a strong fringe of reddish hairs on
their inner margins. The maxill√¶ are of the same
colour as the palpi.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is short and broad; its breadth double
its height and its apex rounded. Its junction with
the <i>sternum</i> appeared to be about at right angles. It is
darker in colour than the maxill√¶, but with a paler apex;
its surface is furnished with bristly hairs, but there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[ 279 ]</a></span>
are no denticulations at its apex. <i>Sternum</i> oval,
truncate before, pointed behind, furnished with
bristly hairs, and of the same colour as the legs.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is of an oblong-oval form, truncate
before, and tolerably convex above; it is of a pale
dull yellowish colour clothed with yellow-grey hairs,
among which are a good many prominent dark
bristly ones; the fore part of the upper side is irregularly
marked with black-brown; following this towards
the hinder part, and reaching half way or more to the
spinners, is an indistinct longitudinal central line of
the same colour, throwing off numerous short lateral
lines at right angles; towards either side of the hinder
two-thirds of the abdomen are several oblique black-brown
lines extending more or less over the sides;
one, about the middle, extends farther over the sides
than the rest, and almost unites with a curved deep
black-brown transverse line crossing the under side of
the abdomen a little way in front of the spinners.</p>

<p>The under side of the abdomen is similar in colour
to the upper side, and, besides the transverse dark
line above mentioned, there is another touching the
anterior margins of the posterior spiracular plates;
the superior pair of spinners are short and strong;
the inferior pair small, and in the ordinary position,
but apparently not (proportionally) so small as
in the females of some other species.</p>

<p>A single adult male was received for examination
from M. Eug√®ne Simon, by whom it was found at Digne
(Basses Alpes, France). M. Simon conjectures that it
may be the male of <i>Nemesia Moggridgii</i> (p. 273),
but some slight differences in the size and positions of
the eyes, and in the pattern on the cephalothorax, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[ 280 ]</a></span>
on the under, as well as the upper, side of the abdomen,
lead me to believe that it is of a different, and hitherto
undescribed species, though probably very closely
allied to some others, especially to <i>Nemesia Manderstjern√¶</i>
(<i>N. meridionalis</i>, Cambr., described, p. 283); in
the present species however the hind-lateral eyes are
much larger in proportion than in <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>.</p>

<p>Adult male, length 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines to 6 lines.</p>

<p>M. Eug√®ne Simon (l.c.) describes, as <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
Latr., both sexes of a spider found by himself in
the Pyrenees and Spanish mountain regions.</p>

<p>Languedoc and Provence are also given as localities,
but it is not clear that he has himself found it in these
latter parts, certainly not the male.</p>

<p>Two examples of this sex, found in the Pyrenees,
and received from M. Simon, are now before me; these
correspond, so far, very exactly to the description he
gives (l.c.); the female I have not seen.</p>

<p>If the position assumed (p. 271) on Latreille's
own authority, that the true male of <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
Latr., (<i>N. carminans</i>, Latr.), has a bifid point to the
prolongation of the palpal bulb, it is clear that the
present species is distinct from that of Latreille.</p>

<p>M. Simon describes this palpal bulb as having its
extreme point "simple et plus effil√©e" (<i>i.e.</i> more
slender than in the preceding species he has described
<i>N. meridionalis</i>). That the examples now before me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[ 281 ]</a></span>
agreeing exactly with this description, are not the males
of the species above described by myself as <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
Latr., from numerous females found at Montpellier,
appears to me clear, not only because I assume that
of the true <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, Latr., males will be found to
have the point of the palpal bulb bifid, but because the
position of the eyes is markedly different in M.
Simon's Pyrenean males and the Montpellier females.
In the latter the eyes of the front row are separated
from each other by equal intervals, in the former
the interval between those of the central pair is very
perceptibly greater than that between each and the
lateral of the same row nearest to it. The interval
also between each of the fore-central eyes and the
hind-central on its side is proportionally much less.</p>

<p>It appears therefore necessary to characterize <i>N.
c√¶mentaria</i> (Sim. l.c.) by some other name, for if
eventually it should be found that Latreille has erred in
<i>N. carminans</i> (with the <i>bifid point</i> to the palpal bulb)
being the male of his <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, and that the
Montpellier species has a male with a <i>simple point</i>
to this part, even then the present spider cannot retain
its name (<i>c√¶mentaria</i>), being distinct from the
females found at Montpellier.</p>

<p>It is possible, of course, that the present species
may hereafter be found, perhaps abundantly, at Montpellier;
in that case it will have to be decided which
of the two is most likely to be the species described
by Latreille. In that eventuality it seems to me
that the spider, above described from Montpellier,
would be more probably Latreille's species, for one
of its specific characters is a tolerably distinct and
bold series of, not more than, five dark angular bars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[ 282 ]</a></span>
along the middle of the upper side of the abdomen,
agreeing exactly with Dug√®s' figures in the <i>R√®gne
Animal</i> of Cuvier, quoted above (p. 271); while in
M. Simon's Pyrenean spider, the abdominal pattern
of the female described by him, does not agree with
this: "il est orn√© d'une fine ligne noire longitudinale,
un peu ondul√©e, pr√©sentant de nombreuses ramifications,
s'√©tendant sur les parties lat√©rales" (l.c.
p. 26). The males before me accord with this description,
though (as M. Simon also remarks) the "s√©rie
de fins accents bruns transverses" is "peu visibles et
souvent effac√©s" (l.c., p. 25); in one example this
pattern is fairly distinct, in the other it is scarcely
recognisable.</p>

<p>The present is a larger spider than <i>N. incerta</i> (the
male found by M. Simon at Digne); it is also less
distinctly marked both on the cephalothorax and
abdomen. The position of the eyes is different, and
so also is the palpal bulb; in that species the spine
describes a simple curve with a strong outward direction;
in the present it is slightly but perceptibly
<i>sinuous</i>, and its general direction is <i>parallel to the
radial joint of the palpus</i>; the spines also at the
upper fore extremity of the radial joint are 5-6 in
number instead of three. The outer side of the genual
joint of each of the legs of the third pair has three
spines; that on the left side, however, of one example,
has four. The palpal bulb also appears to be proportionally
smaller than that of <i>N. dubia</i>, or of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>,
Auss. (<i>N. meridionalis</i>, Cambr.)</p>

<p>Another difference may here be noted between the
present species and the Montpellier <i>c√¶mentaria</i>. M.
Simon (<i>in lit.</i>) separates his <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[ 283 ]</a></span>
others by the length of the patella and tibia (genual
and tibial joints) of the fourth pair of legs, exceeding
in length that of the cephalothorax and falces.</p>

<p>This character has not been found to exist in
several females of the Montpellier species, minutely
measured by Mr. Moggridge; in them the length of
the cephalothorax and falces were found to exceed
that of the genual and tibial joints of the fourth pair
of legs, by from 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 2 mm.</p>

<p>In regard to the relative length of the legs of the
present species this was 4, 1, 2, 3 in the one example
examined, and 4, 1, 2-3 in the other, both being
males.</p>

<p>It is a matter of regret that nothing, as yet, has
been accurately observed in regard to the particular
type or form of the nest of <i>N. dubia</i>.</p>

sex of a <i>Nemesia</i>, described about the same time by
M. Eug√®ne Simon as <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa, in <i>Aran√©ides
nouv. ou peu connus du Midi de l'Europe</i>, p. 21
(separate copy). The species described by M. Simon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[ 284 ]</a></span>
was found by himself abundantly in Corsica. He also
gives Italy and Provence as localities, but the former
of these two is, I conclude, given as being <i>Costa's</i>
locality for the spider described by this latter author
in <i>Fauna d. Regn. Napl. Arachn.</i>, p. 14; the other
locality (Provence) would seem to have been doubtfully
given. On careful examination of the Corsican
examples (male and female), and on comparing them
with the male and female of <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Cambr.,
as well as the description and figure given by Costa, I
feel no doubt but that M. Simon is right in according
to the Corsican species M. Costa's name&mdash;<i>meridionalis</i>.
It agrees, I think, decidedly better, on the whole,
with Costa's figure and description than the species
to which (l.c.) I had allotted the specific name <i>meridionalis</i>
conferred by that author. Nor had I any
hesitation in accepting the determination made by
M. Simon, in <i>Bull. Ent. Soc. Fr.</i>, 1873, s√©r. v. tom.
3, c.; that my <i>N. meridionalis</i> &#9792; is the female of
<i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, Auss., the more especially as
since the publication of my description I have
received from the same locality (Mentone) not
only the male of the spider described by myself
(l.c.), but also the type of M. Ausserer's description
of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> (found at Nice), and
believe these to be identical in species. There is,
indeed, a difference in the, apparent, relative positions
and colour of the eyes of the two spiders, but no more
than may be well accounted for by the condition of
M. Ausserer's type (most kindly lent to me for examination
by its owner, Dr. Ludwig Koch); this
example is much shrunken, having the appearance of
having been allowed to get dry and then to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[ 285 ]</a></span>
again immersed in spirit. This would (I have
frequently found it so in other spiders) cause even
the hard integument of the cephalothorax to contract,
and so cause the eyes to shrink up together into a
closer group, as well as to sink down into the cuticle,
making some of them appear smaller than they
really are. Alternate drying and wetting again in
spirit would also account for the yellowish brown
colour of the eyes, whereas in the male of the Mentone
spider the eyes of the hinder row are pearly grey, and
of the front row dark grey. Beyond these differences
I can find no distinction between them.</p>

<p>The male of the present species is very nearly
allied to both <i>N. incerta</i> (p. 276) from the Pyrenees,
and <i>N. dubia</i> (p. 280) from Digne, of both of which,
as remarked (l.c.), the male sex alone is known to
me; it is, however, larger than either, more richly
coloured, and more distinctly marked. In all three
species the elongated portion of the palpal bulb has a
simple point, but in the present spider it is not drawn
out so finely and gradually: some portion of its
extremity being, though very fine yet really, cylindrical,
and not tapering off into a hair-like termination;
the general direction of the palpal bulb is parallel
with the radial joint, but the point which is equally
curved is directed outwards and a little downwards;
the radial joint has four spines at the fore extremity
on the upper side (in one of the examples there were
however seven on the radial joint of the right palpus),
and the genual joint of each leg of the third pair, in
both examples from Mentone as well as in M. Ausserer's
example from Nice, has three spines on its outer
side. This character was not remarked upon in the description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[ 286 ]</a></span>
of <i>N. meridionalis</i> &#9792; (Cambr. l.c.). It is not
invariable in a long series of female examples; occasionally
one is found with four spines on one of these
genual joints, in others there is occasionally but one
spine and sometimes (but rarely) none; perhaps in this
case broken off? I am inclined to attach some importance
as a specific character to the number, presence,
or absence of these spines on the outer side of the
genual joint of the third pair of legs; not that it is an
invariable character, few, if any, specific characters are
absolute and invariable, nor that it is of more importance
than the armature of other portions of the different
legs, but as being more easily observed and
less liable to injury than the larger and more numerous
spines on other parts. Equally useful in
specific determination are the spines at the fore-extremity
on the upper side of the radial joint of the
palpus. This, however, applies only to the male,
whereas the character derived from the spines on
the genual joints of the third pair of legs applies to
both sexes.</p>

<p>Another character by which the present species
(&#9792;) may be distinguished from <i>N. dubia</i> (<i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
Sim.) is that the former is rather narrower
at the fore-extremity of the caput, which is also less
elevated, being almost equally level with the thorax.</p>

<p>The description of the female given (l.c. <i>supra</i>)
needs but little addition. It may be noticed, however,
that the central longitudinal tapering orange
band on the caput is faintly continued to the extreme
hinder margin of the thorax, and the thoracic fovea is
rather sharply curved. The intervals between the
eyes is the same as in those of <i>N. Moggridgii</i>, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[ 287 ]</a></span>
their absolute size in some examples appeared to be
smaller. In both sexes there are several small, black,
tooth-like, tubercular spines on the inner side of the
base of each maxilla, but none at the apex of the
labium.</p>

<p>The colour of the <i>cephalothorax</i> in the male is
bright-reddish orange-yellow; a large portion of the
sides of the caput, and the ocular area also, is black-brown;
the middle of the thorax is distinctly marked
with black-brown lines radiating to the thoracic
fovea.</p>

<p>Other, less deep, brown markings are mixed with
these radiating lines; there are a few prominent
bristles in front of the ocular area, a single longitudinal
line of erect bristles along the middle of the
orange band from the eyes to the thoracic fovea,
and the whole cephalothorax is more or less clothed
with greyish-yellow adpressed hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are of a deep blackish red-brown colour,
longitudinally striped with yellow-greyish hairs mixed
with dark bristles; and there are some strong spines
at the fore extremity on the inner side.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is oval, tolerably convex above, of a
dull, pale, straw colour, suffused with brown at its
fore extremity, whence an indistinct central longitudinal
band tapers to a point rather more than half
way to the spinners; on either side of this band
are some oblique, lateral, brown lines, which become
broken chevrons, between the termination of the
central band and the spinners. The sides are
obscurely and irregularly marked with brown, and
the under side is of a uniform dull straw-yellow; the
abdomen is clothed thickly with mixed yellow-grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[ 288 ]</a></span>
and dark hairs; the upper side is furnished also with
strong, nearly erect bristly black ones.</p>

<p>Each <i>tarsus</i> terminates with three claws; those of
the superior pair are pectinated beneath, but the
number of teeth appears to vary in the different legs,
from six to eight. The tibial joint of the first pair
is of the same character as that in the males of other
species: it has a strong black curved spine directed
inwards from the fore extremity of the under side,
and a short bluntish-conical, but very distinct prominence
at the same extremity on the inner side, not
far from the base of the curved spine, <a href="#Plate_XX">Plate XX</a>,
fig. B 4 and C; the colour of the legs is yellow,
tinged with orange, the upper sides of the femora
being nearly black; the palpi are similar in colour,
the upper side of the humeral joints being suffused
with a blackish hue.</p>

<p>The relative length of the legs is not constant; in
one example it was 4, 3, 1, 2, in the other 4, 1, 2, 3,
2 and 3 being very nearly equal. Similar variations
are also found in the legs of the female.</p>

<p>In regard to the nest of this species, researches made
subsequently to the publication of <i>Harvesting Ants and
Trap-door Spiders</i> have proved it to be of rather a
different form from that there represented; thus in
the main tube, just before the inner door is reached,
there is a descending branch running off from the
main tube at the same angle as the ascending branch,
but in an opposite direction; in the older and larger
nests the descending branch becomes choked with
d√©bris; it is more distinct in the nests of the younger
spiders, and is always more or less distinctly traceable.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;In the above details there have been only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[ 289 ]</a></span>
one or two special distinctions observed between the
two male examples examined. It should however be
noted that in one (the one captured behind a stone
wall) the ocular area was slightly narrower in proportion
to its length, and the interval between the eyes
of each lateral pair rather less.</p>

<p>Adult male, length 6<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> lines (14 mm.), female adult,

<p>The examination of an adult example of each sex
of this spider received from M. Simon, by whom they
were found in Corsica, leads me to conclude that we
have here the true <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa, as certainly
at least as it is possible at present to identify the
species by the insufficient description and figures
given by this author.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> appear to be less closely massed together
than in <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, but in other respects no
particularly tangible difference is to be noted; the
interval however between the eyes of each lateral pair
is perhaps rather greater. Between the male and the
female of the present species there is a decided difference
in the relative position of the eyes. In the
female the fore-centrals are nearer together than each
is to the fore-lateral on its side, while in the male, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[ 290 ]</a></span>
fore-centrals are wider apart than each is from its fore-lateral.
I have also noted a similar difference in
regard to <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>. The fore-centrals are
also smaller in the female than in the male.</p>

<p>The two species, although bearing such great general
similarity to each other, may be at once distinguished
by several very tangible differences. First in regard
to the <i>male</i>. The <i>cephalothorax</i> of <i>N. meridionalis</i> has
the whole caput of an almost uniform dark brown
colour, two slender yellow lines beginning, one a little
way behind each lateral pair of eyes, and converging
rather quickly towards each other, run on nearly
parallel, but in close proximity together to the
thoracic fovea. The centre of the thorax is
also dark brown, the brown portion formed by radiating
confluent patches, rather than by distinct lines as
in <i>Manderstjern√¶</i>. The curve of the thoracic fovea is
sharp, in fact more in the form of a straight line with
the ends bent down.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> is of nearly one uniform level
and convexity above; the caput being a little more
rounded than the thorax; the eye eminence seemed
to be rather higher than in <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, and
the <i>clypeus</i>, which is steepish, is impressed in the middle
and exceeds in height half that of the facial space;
on the lower margin of the <i>clypeus</i> is a transverse row
of several strong prominent bristles. There were no
bristles behind the eyes, and no appearance of any
having been broken off there (the female, however,
has a single longitudinal row on the caput). The
lateral and hinder margins of the cephalothorax, however,
are, in the male (but not in the female) clothed
with black bristles and bristly hairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[ 291 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are longer than in <i>Manderstjern√¶</i>. The
radial joints have, at the upper fore extremity of each,
five spines, <i>three</i> in front in a transverse line, and <i>two</i>
immediately behind them. The palpal bulb is more
globular, and the spiny production, which is not very
long, springs from it more suddenly, and is <i>strongly
sinuous</i>, its sharp tapering point directed outwards.
The strong sinuosity of this part distinguishes it at
once both from <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i> and all other known
European males with a simple point to the palpal
organs.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are longish and strong; their relative
length 4-1, 3, 2 (male); 4-1, 2, 3 (female); they are
furnished with hairs, bristles, and spines. These do
not appear to call for special notice, except that each
genual joint of those of the third pair has two spines
on its outer side in both sexes.</p>

<p>The superior tarsal claws are denticulated, but the
denticulations differ in number and strength, not only
in the two sexes and in the different legs, but in some
instances in the two superior claws of the same leg.
The denticulations seemed to be more numerous in
the female than in the male.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is elongate oval, and of a straw yellow
colour. In the <i>male</i> the fore part of the upper side
is irregularly black brown, followed by an irregular
somewhat broken longitudinal central bar, and some
broken oblique lines and portions of chevrons. In the
<i>female</i> the fore part is less densely blackish, the
central longitudinal line is obscure, but the oblique
lateral lines are more distinct and less broken, but
none are quite united so as to form chevrons, though
the two or three nearest to the spinners almost do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[ 292 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper side is furnished with numerous strong
nearly erect black bristles.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> has a row, of bristles only, at its apex.</p>

<p>The markings of the cephalothorax in the female
are very nearly like those of that sex in <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>;
the tapering orange yellow band, however,
behind the eyes appears to be rather bolder, as in
that species this band also is faintly traceable quite
to the hinder thoracic margin. The inner corner of
the base of the maxill√¶, in both sexes, has several
minute tooth-like black spines.</p>

<p>The form of the cephalothorax in the female differs
from that of the male; in the latter sex (male) it is
narrower before and rather rounded behind; in the
former sex (female) it is broadest before and more
distinctly hollow-truncate behind; the caput is also
rounder and more elevated. In the female the tarsi
and metatarsi of the two first pairs of legs have close
set brush-like hairs beneath; these are wanting in the
two hinder pairs, and also almost entirely wanting
on the two first pairs in the male.</p>

<p>Various other characters, both peculiar and differential,
are noted in regard to this species by M.
Simon (l.c.). It is to be regretted that this painstaking
observer did not note more exactly the form
and type of its nest; from his description of it, however,
it appears to be branched, but whether the door
is of the wafer or cork type, or whether it has an inner
door or not, is not mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Congener</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, fig. A,
p. 225.</p>

<p>Adult female, length 9 lines (19 mm.).</p>

<p>In general appearance, colours, and markings this
spider bears great resemblance to <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>.
The eyes, however, appeared to be smaller, and the
hind-centrals also smaller in proportion to the rest.
The pale margins of the cephalothorax are in the
present species generally confined to some rather indistinct
pale patches.</p>

<p>The central orange band from the eyes to the
thoracic fovea is, especially in immature examples,
often only a simple tapering line; in others it is larger,
and often composed of three converging narrow orange
bands, which form, in some examples, a broad central
tapering band, marked with two longitudinal dark
lines. The thoracic fovea is curved, but not sharply.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is broadish oval, of a dull clay colour,
marked with dark brown lines, and markings on the
sides and upper side. In some examples these form a
longitudinal central series of curved or slightly angular
lines; in others but little trace of regular chevrons
can be seen.</p>

<p>In the present spider there is also a longitudinal
pale yellowish patch on the inner upper margin of the
falces near their base; they are furnished with hairs in
longitudinal bands, and spines, like others of the genus.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are moderately long, strong, and furnished
with hairs and bristles, and, sparingly, with spines.
The genual joints of the third pair have some spines
on the outer side, varying from one to three in different
examples. The tarsi and metatarsi of the first
and second pairs, as well as the radial and digital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[ 294 ]</a></span>
joints of the palpi, have strong lateral brush-like
fringes of close-set sooty black hairs. The superior
pair of tarsal claws are denticulated, but not uniformly
either in strength, number, or position.</p>

<p>No doubt this will prove a very troublesome spider
to distinguish with certainty from <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>, but
the almost constant presence of a spine or spines on
the outer face of the genual joint of the third pair of
legs seems to be a good distinguishing character; in
no one example out of nine carefully examined could
I detect their absence altogether, while a single spine
even on <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> is rare.</p>

<p>In the present species five examples had three spines
on each of these joints; two had two spines on each;
one had a single spine on each; another had one on
one side, two on the other.</p>

<p>The nest, however, is very characteristic and
peculiar. It is of the wafer-lid type, and so cannot,
from even the outside, be mistaken for that of <i>N.
c√¶mentaria</i>, which is of the cork-lid type; it is, moreover,
branched below, while that of <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i> is
a single unbranched tube. It has also an inside door,
or valve, of very remarkable construction, having two
perfect cork-like faces, securely shutting off either the
branch, or the main tube just above the branch, at
pleasure. By this latter character it is distinguished
also from the tube of <i>N. Manderstjern√¶</i>, as well as by
the absence of a second short branch or cavity, lately
discovered in the nest of this last spider. Examples of
this spider were found, not unfrequently, but invariably
in such nests as that above described, at Hy√®res.</p>

<p>The female sex only has yet been met with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Suffusa</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XVII">Plate XVII</a>, fig. A,
p. 215.</p>

<p>Immature female, length 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines (15<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> mm.).</p>

<p>Although no example was quite adult, this species
may readily be distinguished from all others yet
known to me, by its more elongated form, particularly
the cylindrico-ovate form of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> is oval, broadest towards its posterior
extremity, where it is rounded, the fore-margin
being truncated; the caput is well rounded and convex,
and the thorax perhaps more so than in other species, so
that when looked at in profile there is a considerable
dip or hollow at the thoracic fovea; this fovea forms
a slight curve. Except that the lateral margins are
rather broadly pale towards the hinder part (though
the pale portion is ill-defined), the whole of the cephalothorax
is of a uniform dull yellowish-brown colour;
the extreme lateral margin is marked by a black line,
and in one or two examples there was an indistinct
yellowish central longitudinal line from the eyes to
the thoracic junction, having a single row of prominent
bristles upon it. The whole surface of the
cephalothorax is fairly clothed with dusky yellowish-grey
adpressed hairs: the ordinary grooves and indentations
are well marked.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are on the usual eye eminence, which is
perhaps rather more elevated than ordinary, and its
summit black; their position is ordinary. It may,
however, be noticed that the fore-centrals are placed
more forward than in most of the other known
species; the fore-centrals are about <i>equally</i> separated
from each other, and from the fore-laterals nearest to
each respectively; they are also separated from the hind-central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[ 296 ]</a></span>
nearest to each, by an interval not differing
much from that between each other; the hind-centrals
are distinctly oval, or rather somewhat semilunar in
form, smallest of the eight (except in one example,
when they were almost, if not quite, as large as the
fore-centrals), and at their hindermost point very near,
but not quite contiguous, to the hind-laterals. The
eyes of each lateral pair (of which the hinder is very
nearly equal in size to the fore one), are very near, but not
quite contiguous, to each other; the interval between
them is narrower than that between the corresponding
eyes in almost any other yet described species.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are neither long nor very strong; their
relative length is 4, 1, 2, 3, though between 2 and 3
there is in different examples the same variation
observed in other species; sometimes they are equal,
and sometimes one, and then the other, very slightly
the longest: their colour is pale yellowish, and they
are furnished with hairs, bristles, and spines, but the
latter are not numerous, and appeared to be both
longer and slenderer than usual; the genual joints of
the third pair have spines, from one to three on the
outer side, for the most part, three; the superior tarsal
claws are pectinated (but not uniformly on all the
legs) beneath their hinder portion.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are strong, and similar in colour to the
cephalothorax, but they do not appear to call for any
special remark.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill√¶</i> have a few minute tuberculiform black
teeth at their base on the inner side, and, with the
<i>labium</i> (which has no hairs at its apex) and <i>sternum</i>,
are similar in colour to the legs.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is of an elongated, or cylindrico-ovate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[ 297 ]</a></span>
form, of a dull drab-yellowish colour, with a central,
longitudinal, irregular, rather chocolate-brown bar on
its upper side, and 6 to 7 well-defined lateral oblique
slightly curved lines of the same colour and touching
the central line; between these lines are some other
irregular, but similarly coloured, markings.</p>

<p>The sides are almost immaculate, and the underside
quite so; the spinners are ordinary.</p>

<p>About 10 examples (all immature) were found at
Montpellier in branched tubes closed at the entrance
with a wafer-lid. The branch arises some way below
the entrance and runs up to the surface at an acute
angle with the main tube; there is no lower door,
and thus this tube forms the type of a new form of
nest, being branched, with a wafer-lid, but without a
lower door.</p>

<p>This species cannot be confused with <i>N. c√¶mentaria</i>,
which is found abundantly in the same locality;
both the general form, colours, markings, and nest
readily distinguish it from that species.</p>

p. 211.</p>

<p>Adult female, length rather more than 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> lines
(20 mm.).</p>

<p>This spider is of a proportionally broader and
stouter form than others of the genus <i>Nemesia</i>, and
the cephalothorax (which is entirely glabrous and
destitute of adpressed hairs) has the caput more
rounded and elevated than in any other species of
<i>Nemesia</i> known to me, approaching <i>Cteniza</i> in these
respects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[ 298 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> is oval, truncate, and about
equally broad at each end; the ordinary grooves
and indentations are strong; besides the groove
which indicates its union with the thorax, the caput
has an indented or pinched-in appearance towards its
hinder part on each side. Except that this was
present in all the examples examined (ten) it might
have been taken to be accidental.</p>

<p>The colour of the cephalothorax is dark brown
tinged with yellow, darkest on the sides of the caput,
which is divided longitudinally by a narrow, dull,
orange-yellow line, and lightest on the margins
towards the hinder part; the thoracic fovea is curved,
but more deeply indented and the indentation is wider
at each end than in other species, the ends being a
little turned back: there is a single longitudinal row
of long erect bristles along the central line of the
caput, and a few more on the lower margin of the
clypeus.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> form a narrower oblong area than usual,
owing chiefly to their small size and to those of each
lateral pair being almost contiguous to each other,
separated only by an interval equal to that which
divides each hind-lateral from the hind-central nearest
to it. The hind-centrals are smallest of the eight,
and vary in form, being round, semilunar, or roughly
wedge-shaped, differing at times in the same example.
The eye eminence is less elevated than in
most species, and this brings the fore-centrals nearer
to the straight line of the fore-laterals; these last are
the largest of the eight. The height of the clypeus
exceeds half that of the facial space.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are short and strong; their relative length

4, 1, 3, 2, or 4, 1, 2, 3, or 4, 1, 2-3; they are of a
brownish yellow colour, deeper on their fore-sides,
furnished with hairs, bristles, and spines, the latter
not very numerous nor unusually strong; there are
no spines on the outer sides of the genual joints of the
third pair; the tarsal claws are longish and strong.
Those of the superior pair have but one, two, or three
pectinations on their underside; on some of the legs
I could not detect any. There seemed to be no more
uniformity in the tarsal-claw pectinations in this
species than in others. The tarsal and metatarsal
joints of the legs of the first pair have a fringe of
close-set short blackish hairs on either side, as also
have the digital joints of the palpi, these being similar
to the legs in colour and armature; the humeral joints
are very deep but narrow, being apparently bent and
hollowed on their inner sides to allow of meeting well
over the falces.</p>

<p>The terminal palpal claw has two teeth towards its
base on the underside. I could not ascertain satisfactorily
whether this is or not a uniform character
in all examples; in one example these denticulations
were very plain, but they seemed to be wanting in
others.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are very strong and massive, round in
their profile, and very roundly prominent near their
base on the upper side. They are of a rich deep
black-brown colour, glossy, and furnished along their
inner margins with black bristles and hairs, and with
strong spines at their extremity on the upper side.
The fang is strong, and the outer margin of the
groove in which it lies when at rest has some strong
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[ 300 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>maxill√¶</i> are strong, of normal form, but very
convex on their outer surface.</p>

<p>The small tuberculous teeth noticed at the base on
the inner side of the maxill√¶ of all the other species I
have examined, were visible (though with difficulty)
in this species also.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is broader than it is high, convex on
its face, and rounded at the apex; it is (as also are
the <i>maxill√¶</i> and <i>sternum</i>) of the same colour as the
legs, and clothed with numerous strong bristly hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is short-oval, and strongly convex
above; it is of a dull clay-coloured brown tinged with
chocolate, and along the centre of its upper side is a
series of six strong angular bars or chevrons of a dark
chocolate-brown colour, and pretty distinctly defined,
though, when examined closely, broken in parts.</p>

<p>The intervening spaces between the angular bars
and the sides have a few irregular markings of a
similar colour; and they are connected by a longitudinal
central line of the same hue running through
their apices.</p>

<p>The abdomen is very sparingly clothed with hairs
and fine bristles; the superior pair of spinners are
strong; those of the inferior pair very small and
short.</p>

<p>Examples of this fine and very distinct spider
were found at Bordeaux in simple unbranched tubes,
covered with a wafer-lid, running down very deep into
the earth, in some cases as much as fifteen inches into
an exceedingly hard soil, making it a work of great
labour and care to get them out without injury.</p>

<p>This species can scarcely be confused with any
other yet known; its short robust form, short legs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[ 301 ]</a></span>
more elevated caput, general dark colour, distinct angular
bars on the abdomen, and almost contiguous
lateral eyes, as well as the form of the nest, will
readily distinguish it.</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I connect with this
spider the name of my most kind friend and brother
arachnologist, Monsieur Eug√®ne Simon, to whom I
am so greatly indebted for much information and
numerous examples of rare spiders.</p>

<p>I must not conclude these descriptions without
expressing my sense of obligation to Mr. Moggridge
for so kindly allowing me to add them to the far
more popular, and more interesting, portion of this
volume, in which the <i>habits</i> of these spiders are
recorded.</p>

<p>Descriptions of <i>colour</i>, <i>form</i>, and <i>structure</i> are but
dry details, though very necessary for the determination
of species; and in the present case it is
very important as well as interesting to be able to
conclude with some certainty that differences of type
in the tubular nests of the spiders Mr. Moggridge
has observed so closely and accurately, are joined to
well-marked specific differences obtained from those
other characters above mentioned, and which it has
been my endeavour to detail as fully and faithfully as
possible.</p>

<p><b>NEW SERIES OF NATURAL HISTORY
FOR BEGINNERS.</b></p>


<p><span class="tbhigh">*<span class="tblow">*</span>*</span> A good introductory series of books on Natural History for
the use of students and amateurs is still a <i>desideratum</i>. Those at
present in use have been too much compiled from antiquated sources;
whilst the figures, copied in many instances from sources equally antiquated,
are far from accurate, the colouring of them having become
degenerated through the adoption, for the sake of cheapness, of
mechanical processes.</p>

<p>The present series will be entirely the result of original research
carried to its most advanced point; and the figures, which will be
chiefly engraved on steel, by the artist most highly renowned in each
department for his technical knowledge of the subjects, will in all
cases be drawn from actual specimens, and coloured separately by
hand.</p>

<p>Each work will treat of a department of Natural History sufficiently
limited in extent to admit of a satisfactory degree of
completeness.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
